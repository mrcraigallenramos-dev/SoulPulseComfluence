# Soul Bonding

The Soul Bond is a rare metaphysical link between two resonants, harmonizing their Vitaflow across distance and even death.

## Stages of a Soul Bond
1. **Recognition** – Instinctual attraction, shared dreams, empathy, location-sense.  
2. **Resonance** – Synchronization of Nexus Points; Vitaflow sharing and healing.  
3. **Harmony** – Perfect complementary balance; combat coordination, trauma healing.  
4. **Confluence** – Temporary merging of consciousness; memory integration, reality alteration.  
5. **Transcendence** – Permanent soul fusion, divine resonance, survival beyond death.

## Strategic Implications
- **Love as Vulnerability** – Betrayal disrupts Vitaflow, risking collapse.  
- **Weaponization of Love** – Intimacy exploited strategically. Tiffani manipulates Jhace.  
- **Love as Redemption** – Bonds can heal, redeem, and restore balance.
