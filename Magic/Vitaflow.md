# Vitaflow: The Laws of Soul Energy

Vitaflow is the raw energy of soul and emotion that powers the magic of Soul Resonance. It is governed by practical laws and immutable principles.

## Core Laws of Magic
1. **Soulpulse Frequency** – Unique pulse modulated by emotions and faith.  
2. **World Spine Resonance** – Omnipresent hum binding matter and spirit.  
3. **Confluence** – Matching pulse to Spine to alter reality.  
4. **Tether IDs** – Metaphysical bonds linking resonants and others.  
5. **Cost** – Every act demands physical, emotional, or spiritual payment.

## The Seven Immutable Principles
1. **Conservation of Soul Energy** – Cannot be created or destroyed. Overuse leads to Soul Burn.  
2. **Resonance Compatibility** – Harmonious vs destructive interference.  
3. **Emotional Authenticity Requirement** – Power scales with emotional honesty.  
4. **The Nexus Point Hierarchy** – Must master lower Nexus before higher.  
5. **Transformation Thresholds** – Emotional breakthroughs required.  
6. **Reality Resistance** – Universe resists major change; costs scale.  
7. **The Bleed Principle** – All use leaves Resonance Bleed, altering personality and body.

## Costs of Confluence
- **Physical** – Bleeding, cracked bones, crystallization, accelerated aging, organ failure, Soul Burn.  
- **Emotional** – Numbness, zealotry, haunting trauma.  
- **Social** – Tethers audited and punished if abused.  
- **Spiritual** – Divine principles shape and consume the user.
