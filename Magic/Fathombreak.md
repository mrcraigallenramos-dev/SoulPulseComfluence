# Fathombreak and Post-Rupture Resonance

Resonants hit a ceiling of power. Only extreme trauma can rupture it in a **Fathombreak**, unleashing catastrophic resonance.

## Pre-Fathombreak Abilities
- **Form Whisper** – Coax stability into matter.  
- **Wholeness Knot** – Bind fractures.  
- **Purity Spark** – Burn away impurities.  
- **Decay Drift** – Controlled decay to clear failures.

## Fathombreak
Triggered by betrayal, grief, or fury. Soul cracks open; resonance saturates reality. Eyes bleed.  
**Consequences:** Emotional anchors, uncontrolled tethers, shortened lifespan.

## Post-Fathombreak Combat Resonance
- **Overtone State** – Battlefield warped by Principle.  
- **Ascension Surge** – Flight, leaving trails of Principle’s energy.  
- **Pulse Rupture** – Resonance strike.  
- **Confluence Cannon** – Sustained soulpulse beam.  
- **Godvein Surge** – Polyphonic eruption channeling deity.  
- **Resonance Bastion** – Defensive confluence shield.  
- **Exile Dirge** – Final devastating move leaving user hollow or dead.

## Resonance Forms
Progression to higher states of power (see [[Resonance_Forms]]).
