# Soul Resonance

Soulpulse Confluence is a gear-punk, grimdark fantasy universe where the fabric of existence hums with living vibration.  
Every being carries a Soulpulse Frequency—the personal thrum of its essence.  
Beneath that personal music lies the World Spine Resonance, an endless, low note that binds machinery, nature, and souls.  
By bringing their own frequency into confluence with this world resonance, resonants can influence machines, bodies, and even emotions.

## Core Laws of Magic
1. **Soulpulse Frequency** – Every sentient creature has a unique, measurable frequency. Emotions, experiences, and faith modulate this pulse.  
2. **World Spine Resonance** – An omnipresent hum that ties matter and spirit together. When the World Spine is disrupted (by Rot, grief, or excess power), reality becomes brittle.  
3. **Confluence** – When a resonant matches their pulse with the World Spine, they can influence machines, bodies, and emotions. The closer the match, the greater the effect—and the greater the cost.  
4. **Tether IDs** – Deep resonance alterations create metaphysical tethers linking resonants and others. If the resonant falls or dies, tethered beings risk collapse.  
5. **Cost** – Confluence is transactional: blood, memory, accelerated aging, emotional blunting—each act demands a price.

## Nexus Point Mechanics
Root Nexus through Crown Nexus govern survival, creativity, will, love, truth, perception, and transcendence. Each requires emotional breakthroughs to master.

## Stages of Power
- **Resonant Tasks (Pre-Fathombreak)** – Subtle coaxing of the world.  
- **Fathombreak** – Soul cracks open under trauma; resonance roars.  
- **Combat Resonance (Post-Fathombreak)** – Weaponized pulse, Overtone States, Ascension Surge, Pulse Rupture, Confluence Cannon, Godvein Surge, Resonance Bastion, Exile Dirge.

## Costs and Consequences
Resonance is never free.  
- **Physical:** Bleeding, crystallization, aging, organ failure.  
- **Emotional:** Numbness, zealotry, haunting trauma.  
- **Social:** Tether fragility, collective risk.  
- **Spiritual:** Divine attention and demands.  
- **Soul Burn:** Permanent spiritual damage from overuse.
