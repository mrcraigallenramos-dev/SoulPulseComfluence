# The Four Divine Principles

The Divine Principles are the opposing forces born from the First Spark, the first wound of the universe. Their friction fuels existence.

## Form (Xilcore)
- Governs structure, pattern, permanence.  
- **God:** Xilcore, pure unbending order, logic. His extremes create chaos.  
- **Manifestations:** Crystal shards, geometric light, lattices. Machinery obeys.  
- **Costs:** Body ossifies, joints stiffen, emotions rigid. Risk of shattering.

## Wholeness (Leesa)
- Governs unity, harmony, completion.  
- **Goddess:** Leesa, born of symmetry, friction-smoothing unity. Risks stifling growth.  
- **Manifestations:** Harmonic ribbons, soft light, choral tones. Wounds heal.  
- **Costs:** Pain of others becomes theirs; individuality dissolves.

## Purity (Blemo)
- Governs cleansing, refinement, clarity.  
- **God:** Blemo, crystallized from laws of Xilcoreâ€™s star. Purges flaws blindly.  
- **Manifestations:** White light, heat, pristine aura. Souls scoured clean.  
- **Costs:** Burns indiscriminately; memory, empathy, humanity consumed.

## Decay (Seeri)
- Governs entropy, corrosion, destruction.  
- **Goddess:** Seeri, decay of perfection, entropy incarnate. Necessary but consuming.  
- **Manifestations:** Rust, ash, collapse. Bonds and structures unravel.  
- **Costs:** Body ages, sanity frays, despair consumes.
