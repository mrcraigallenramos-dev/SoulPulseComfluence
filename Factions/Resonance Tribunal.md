# The Resonance Tribunal

| | |
|---|---|
| **Core Ideology** | "Divine order must be maintained at all costs; any deviation from established dogma is heresy." |
| **Key Figures** | [[Marael]] (Ex-Member) |
| **Vibe / Aesthetic** | Ancient cathedrals, rigid dogma, the scent of old incense and fear, ornate robes, and the crushing weight of unquestionable authority. |

## Overview & Philosophy
The Resonance Tribunal is the dominant religious authority in Aethelgard, a theocratic institution that believes in a rigid, divinely ordained hierarchy. They see themselves as the ultimate arbiters of morality and truth, tasked with maintaining the perceived purity of the World Spine and its Resonance. Their primary objective is to enforce cosmic order by suppressing dissent and guiding humanity along a predetermined spiritual path, viewing any deviation as a threat to the fabric of existence. The suffering caused by their rigid control is the source of [[Alara]]'s core trauma.

## Structure & Methods
The Tribunal is a strict theocracy, organized in a rigid hierarchy of priests, inquisitors, and arbiters. Their strategic approach is a "long game," favoring psychological warfare and spiritual pressure over direct military conflict. They are masters of controlling the narrative, using dogma and fear to manipulate the masses and discredit their opponents. They exert their influence through a vast network of informants and by applying immense political pressure on other factions, only deploying their own militant orders as a last resort.

## Strengths & Vulnerabilities
**Strengths**:
* They wield immense spiritual and political influence over the more traditional populations of Aethelgard.
* Their mastery of information control and psychological warfare allows them to shape events from the shadows.

**Vulnerabilities**:
* Their rigid adherence to dogma makes them slow to adapt to new or unconventional threats.
* The God Shock and the fall of the Ceiling directly challenged their narrative of absolute divine control, weakening their legitimacy and creating fertile ground for revolutionary movements.
* A significant internal schism exists between hardline traditionalists and more moderate factions, which can be exploited by their enemies.

## Inter-Factional Dynamics
- **Alliances**: They maintain a cautious, pragmatic alliance with [[The Vitaflow Merchants]]. This is a relationship of mutual utility, not trust, where the Tribunal gains economic resources and the Merchants gain a veil of legitimacy.
- **Enemies**: They are actively hostile to revolutionary groups like the [[Ceiling Breakers]] and nihilistic cults like the Void Seekers, viewing them as existential threats to cosmic order that must be eradicated.
- **Complex Relations**: Their emphasis on rigid, dogmatic law often clashes with the empathetic, individual-focused philosophy of [[The Healing Gardens]], leading to constant friction.
