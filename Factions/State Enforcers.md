# State Enforcers

| | |
|---|---|
| **Core Ideology** | "Resonance is a debt. Every tether is a risk, and all accounts must be balanced." |
| **Key Figures** | [[Vael]] |
| **Vibe / Aesthetic** | Worn, practical uniforms; the cold, impartial air of an auditor; the quiet threat of absolute authority; the scent of old ledgers and sterile tools. |

## Overview & Philosophy
The State Enforcers are a cross-factional regulatory body, acting as part police force and part metaphysical accountants. Their core philosophy, embodied by agents like [[Vael]], is that Soul Resonance is not a gift but a dangerous force that incurs a debt with every use. They believe that reckless "heroism," particularly acts that create vast networks of tethers, generates a centralized risk that threatens systemic collapse. Their grim purpose is to enforce the harsh but necessary consequences of resonance use, ensuring that all accounts are eventually, and often brutally, balanced.

## Structure & Methods
The Enforcers are a disciplined, likely hierarchical, organization of specialized agents. Their primary method is not open warfare but investigation and auditing. They meticulously track **Tether IDs** across the kingdoms, enforce legal limits on Soulpulse expenditure, and are tasked with hunting down resonants who become too powerful, too reckless, or who "bend the rules to save lives". They operate with the cold, impartial authority of auditors executing an unchangeable law of nature.

## Strengths & Vulnerabilities
**Strengths**:
* Their broad, cross-factional jurisdiction gives them unique authority and access to sensitive information like the global tether ledgers.
* Their agents are highly disciplined specialists, trained specifically to analyze, track, and contain powerful resonants.
* Their authority is generally respected, or at least feared, by other major factions who understand the danger of unchecked resonance.

**Vulnerabilities**:
* They are likely a small, underfunded organization, spread thin across a world of increasingly powerful individuals.
* Their rigid adherence to the "math of consequences" can make them appear cruel and inflexible, earning them few true allies.
* They may be blind to more subtle, political, or economic threats that don't register on their metaphysical ledgers.

## Inter-Factional Dynamics
- **Alliances**: The State Enforcers have no true alliances, as their mandate requires them to be impartial. They may have temporary, working relationships with factions like [[The Resonance Tribunal]] or [[The Iron Republics]] when their goals of maintaining order align, but they are just as likely to be investigating those factions' most powerful members.
- **Enemies**: They are the natural antagonists to chaotic individuals like [[Jhace]] (in his early arc) and revolutionary groups like the [[Ceiling Breakers]], whose actions create massive, unpredictable tether networks.
- **Complex Relations**: They have a tense but necessary relationship with factions like [[The Healing Gardens]]. While the Gardens' work is benevolent, their widespread healing creates a vast number of tethers that the Enforcers must audit and view as a potential systemic risk.
