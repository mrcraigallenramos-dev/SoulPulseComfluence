# The Found Family

| | |
|---|---|
| **Core Ideology** | "To protect each other and find a path forward in a broken world; to be the family you choose, not the one you're given." |
| **Key Figures** | [[Jhace]], [[Ember (The Null Child)]], [[Vael]], [[Brighlee]], (former: [[Alara]]) |
| **Vibe / Aesthetic** | A flickering campfire in the vast darkness; mismatched gear and scavenged tools; quiet moments of shared grief and gallows humor; a chaotic circle bound not by creed, but by choice. |

## Overview & Philosophy
The Found Family is not a bannered faction but a circle of survivors and outcasts who have chosen each other against a world of systems, betrayals, and divine decrees. Centered around [[Jhace]], they serve as the emotional axis of the saga.  

Their philosophy is lived, not written: **no one heals alone.** They stand in defiance of institutions that promise salvation through order, purity, or progress, insisting instead that survival and hope can only come through *connection*. In their loyalty, they embody Wholeness — fractured, imperfect, but enduring.

## Structure & Methods
The Found Family has no hierarchy, only roles shaped by crisis:  
- **[[Jhace]]** — the unstable heart, a healer addicted to saving.  
- **[[Vael]]** — reluctant strategist, truth-teller, enforcer turned protector.  
- **[[Brighlee]]** — the amplifier, journalist, and conscience of the group.  
- **[[Ember (The Null Child)]]** — silent compass, paradox, and key to mysteries.  
- **[[Alara]]** — once their mentor and moral center, whose betrayal scars them deeply.  

Their methods are improvisational: mending what can be mended, sabotaging what cannot, protecting the innocent, and surviving overwhelming odds with wit, resonance, and love. Where larger factions maneuver armies, the Found Family acts in **intimacy** — a whisper, a single choice, a tether held fast.

## Strengths & Vulnerabilities
**Strengths**:  
* Their unconditional loyalty creates a resonance greater than the sum of its parts.  
* Diversity of Principles ([[Wholeness]], [[Decay]], [[Null]], and amplification) makes them uniquely adaptable.  
* Small, mobile, and unpredictable, they slip through the cracks that larger factions cannot.  

**Vulnerabilities**:  
* Emotionally fragile — a wound to one member can fracture them all.  
* Lacking resources, infrastructure, and legitimacy, they are perpetually outgunned.  
* Internal friction — Vael’s cynicism, Brighlee’s idealism, Jhace’s instability — risks pulling them apart.  

## Inter-Factional Dynamics
- **Alliances**: They ally with groups like the [[Ceiling Breakers]] or [[Healing Gardens]] when goals align, though trust is always tentative.  
- **Enemies**: They are hunted by [[The Resonance Tribunal]] and [[The Iron Republics]], who see them as destabilizing threats, and stalked by [[Tiffani]]’s hidden grand design.  
- **Complex Relations**: Their bond with the [[State Enforcers]] is strained by Vael’s defection — her loyalty to the Found Family turns their auditors into occasional reluctant allies, occasional ruthless hunters.
