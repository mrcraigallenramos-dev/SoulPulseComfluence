Logline: Lanterns rise, a bell is hoisted, quarrels are softened, and two people dare to plan a tomorrow that fate is already unspooling.

Beats:
- Humanâ€‘scale win: community breathes easier; friction as jostle and song not sermon.
- Tiffani lets herself want what she will later weaponize; she hates herself for it and keeps going.
- Final beat: hands clasped, unaware of the room that isnâ€™t.
