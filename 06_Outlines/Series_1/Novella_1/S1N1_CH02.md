Logline: The Foundry Fire and Luthenâ€™s lesson on the flawed gear fuse Jhaceâ€™s ethicâ€”rigidity breaksâ€”and his fear of brittle perfection in metal and people.

Beats:
- Salvage sparks a sensory flashbackâ€”red heat, perfect struts snapping clean, ceilings screamingâ€”before Master Luthen drags Jhace clear.
- Luthenâ€™s â€œshining cageâ€ lesson: a small imperfection gives systems room to bend and live; the flawed gear becomes talisman and worldview.
- Back in the present, Tiffani coaxes the story with profanityâ€‘laced tenderness and files the ethic as both love language and leverage.
- Cost echo: Jhaceâ€™s wrists ache brittle; Tiffani rubs circulation back and takes a sympathetic tremor in return.
