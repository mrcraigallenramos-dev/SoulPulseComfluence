Logline: Rumors of the Debug Vault and Father Morr surface, but Tiffani deflects Jhace from the void with heat and humor because the fuse isnâ€™t ready.

Beats:
- Fence mentions a roomâ€‘thatâ€‘isnâ€™t and a priest who tunes sinners, seeding vault and Morr as street myth, not mission.
- A scuffle breaks; Tiffani binds tempers for seconds, taking a sharp headache and a grief echo as price.
- She steers Jhace away with pastry and profanity, laughing off the void while memorizing the hint.
