Logline: A woman paces a waveform floor, ticking off seedlingsâ€”flawed gear, soft threat, DEBUG shardâ€”and notes â€œsheâ€ is adapting faster than projections, useful and inconvenient.

Beats:
- The room catalogs nudges and yields; â€œfriction must be fed or reality starvesâ€ as private theorem.
- Names never spoken; â€œsheâ€ is assessed alongside Vael, Father Morr, and â€œthe vault,â€ misdirection airtight.
- Final line: â€œNot yet,â€ to the quiet bells, and the room forgets itself.
