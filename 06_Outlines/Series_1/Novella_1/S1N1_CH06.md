Logline: Jhace wants a perfect replacement; Tiffani argues for give, and together they repair steel and spirits under constraint.

Beats:
- They choose reinforcement over replacement; Form and Wholeness complement under time and resource scarcity.
- Personal tolls: glassy wrist ache for Jhace; Tiffani cries alone after absorbing a widowâ€™s panic.
- Private humor and touch cool the sting and tighten the bond without rushing consummation.
