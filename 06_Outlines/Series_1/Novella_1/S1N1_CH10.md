Logline: The flawed gear story is told between them and becomes a sacred joke that means love and survival.

Beats:
- A scrap dealer wants the talisman; Jhace refuses on reflex, revealing its weight.
- Tiffani teases, then listens; â€œrigidity breaksâ€ enters their couple canon with a grin and a swear.
- They fix a kettle line for coin, trading burns and laughter as foreplay of trust.
