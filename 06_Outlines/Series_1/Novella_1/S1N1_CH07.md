Logline: A tidy contract tries to cage Jhaceâ€™s hours; Tiffani smiles and knives it with one question about who pays when a tuner drops out of harmony.

Beats:
- Clerk pitches â€œauthorized fixesâ€ with liability language around harmony and dropouts, embedding tethers in commerce.
- Tiffani flips the premise, souring the offer without burning the contact.
- After, bread and gallows humor about polite ownership; heat simmers under jokes.
