Logline: Vaelâ€™s Bone Blade hums near a dangerous harmonic in the Dregs; she marks the anomaly and waits for a necessary ending.

Beats:
- Establish the Blade: android rib, unstainable, vibrates near divine sickness and godâ€‘scale flux.
- Vaelâ€™s doctrine: endings over brittle order; decay as mercy when systems fossilize.
- The Blade thrums subtly; she notes a trail without naming Jhace and keeps her distance.
- Far below, Tiffani clocks the silhouette and changes their route with a joke.
