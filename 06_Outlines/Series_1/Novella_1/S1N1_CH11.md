Logline: A Rot hiss meets a Purity Spark done like a scalpel; Tiffani staggers, Jhace carries her, and a prayer ledger takes their names.

Beats:
- Purity as burn and clarity used minimally to respect cost and avoid zealotry drift.
- Social tethering ritualized as gratitude; groundwork for Vaelâ€™s enforcement ethos.
- Private tenderness up three flights, mouths cursing sweet into shoulder in relief.
