Logline: Jhace quiets a failing pump with a Form whisper as Tiffani smooths a crowdâ€™s fear, both paying small costs while masking a natural pull with grit and banter.

Beats:
- Open on gearâ€‘punk textureâ€”turbines grinding their teeth, pipes ticking like nervesâ€”while a pump coughs offâ€‘pitch despair until Jhace coaxes it to remember its intended shape with a nosebleed cost.
- Tiffani uses a breathâ€‘long Wholeness Knot to calm a fraying crowd, absorbing a headache and a strangerâ€™s panic as her private toll.
- They banter over missing ledger stamps and sloppy math, chemistry sparking in profanity and dry humor without naming it romance.
- A superstitious worker marks down their names in gratitude, foreshadowing cultural tethers and social obligations around resonance.
- Button: Jhace unconsciously taps the flawed gear in his pocket; Tiffani notices the tell and files it away.
