Logline: They joke about perfect lovers and decide boredom is worse than bruises, then finally kiss like a relief valve popping.

Beats:
- Filthy humor relieves pressure; profanity signals safety and desire.
- Promise: tell each other before doing something stupid, a rule 1.5 will rupture.
- Far siren; Vael turns her head, uneasy without knowing why.
