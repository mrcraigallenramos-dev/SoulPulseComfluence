Logline: A DEBUGâ€‘stamped fragment maps a void beside the sewers, and Tiffani pockets it like trash, like treasure.

Beats:
- Artifact planted, not activated; the void sits in their future like a low drumbeat.
- A far hum passes over skin; Vael pauses on a roof and frowns into the wind.
- They choose the bar over the void and promise tomorrow.
