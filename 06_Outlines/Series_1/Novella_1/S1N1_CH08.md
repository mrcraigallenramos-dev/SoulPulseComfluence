Logline: They listen: the World Spine is a chord of arguments, not a pure note, and it makes them ache in the same place.

Beats:
- Lore as sensation: Form cuts bright, Wholeness warms, Purity stings, Decay sands in teeth, with no labels in dialogue.
- Microâ€‘costs leave them wrung and soft; Tiffani hides that she carried more bleed to steady him.
- A kiss almost happens, ruined by a coughing turbine and shared laughter to save it for 1.3.
