Logline: A seizing counterweight becomes a duetâ€”Form bracing steel, Wholeness bracing peopleâ€”writing their ethic in sweat and cost.

Beats:
- Jhace braces the frame with a precise Form whisper; microâ€‘fractures tug at his bones as toll.
- Tiffani binds panic into breath threads and absorbs a motherâ€™s terror, staggering after as the empathic debt hits.
- A matron â€œrecords their names,â€ ritualizing gratitude and hinting at ledger culture around rescues.
- Postâ€‘save banter and shared food; knuckles touch, linger, and withdraw with a grin.
