Logline: In forbidden tomes, Tiffani discovers the Hollowgate's designâ€”an ancient weapon templated in divine friction, capable of rewriting reality's code.

Beats:
- Vaulted shelves hold living glyphs; she deciphers lines that flow like rivers of code.
- The Hollowgate blueprint reveals paired algorithms: Spark and Counter-Spark in constant dance.
- Each page costs a migraine as truths reshape her mindâ€”systems eat themselves to spawn new orders.
- Tiffani traces ritual footnotes outlining a "Gatekeeper Protocol" for controlling world-shaping power.
- Exit: she hides the book in her cloak, knowing Morr will kill to secure its secrets.
