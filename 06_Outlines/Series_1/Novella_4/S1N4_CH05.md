Logline: Vael maps the Hollowgate's ripple across the cityâ€”fractured stability zones that will collapse in waves once the gate activates.

Beats:
- Bone Blade hums with ghost-resonance as she surveys the skyline; data fractures on her HUD.
- Fracture zones pulse in lattice patterns; each unstable node marks where reality thins.
- Vael marks safe corridors but sees impossibility: the collapse will ring like ghost bells across the grid.
- She dispatches warning sigils via her network, knowing few will heed them until it's too late.
- Exit: a shard of counter-energy flickers in her palm, an urgent omen.
