Logline: Stepping through the Gate, Tiffani beholds a realm of living code and ancient gods, where Form and Wholeness mean nothing against raw creation.

Beats:
- The air tastes of raw math; fractal vines grow across her vision like living algorithms.
- Wholeness finds no purchase; her empathy echoes empty through code-flattened landscapes.
- She reaches for Jhace's hand; he glows with Form bloom, a beacon in infinite geometry.
- An entity of pure Counter-Spark loomsâ€”a god of necessary destruction, eyes of static.
- Exit: the Gate's mechanism locks behind them, and choice dissolves in the face of cosmic inevitability.
