Logline: The Gate's activation metrics exceed projectionsâ€”subjects altered, world scarring controlled, and the Counter-Spark's variables aligned for the final phase.

Beats:
- Data streams confirm stability indexes within acceptable variance, despite existential fractures.
- Subject reports: "Form and Wholeness integration successful; subjects demonstrate adaptive memory of cosmic encounter."
- Counter-Spark anomaly contained within designated scar zones; audit recommends controlled expansion.
- Final note: subjects now ideal vectors for crossover protocolsâ€”prepare for Phase 1.5's harvest.
- The room dims, and quiet bells synchronize with the world's heartbeat in new alignment.
