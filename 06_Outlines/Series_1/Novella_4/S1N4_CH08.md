Logline: As gate activation triggers citywide panic, Tiffani uses Wholeness to hold collapsing minds together through the chaos.

Beats:
- Panic waves slam across the streets; she weaves empathic nets to catch shattered psyches.
- The gate's opening breath rattles windows; each exhale dissolves social cohesion into primal fear.
- Tiffani channels communal hope, knitting shattered emotions into fragile unity.
- A shard of Counter-Spark energy lodges in her heart; empathy wavers between compassion and oblivion.
- Exit: dawn breaks on a trembling city, held together by threads of her will.
