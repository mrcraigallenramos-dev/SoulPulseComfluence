Logline: Vael crosses the Gate's threshold alone to confront the Counter-Spark's avatar and broker a truce before mortal reality unravels.

Beats:
- She breaches the boundary; Bone Blade resonates with Counter-Spark frequencies, singing of entropy and rebirth.
- The avatar's voice is geometryâ€”each word reroutes galaxies.
- She bargains mortal choice for cosmic balanceâ€”blood for code, life for pattern.
- Equations write themselves upon her blade; sacrifice blossoms in divine clarity.
- Exit: blade dims, the avatar retreats into fractal storms, and Vael falls across the threshold back into the Gatehouse.
