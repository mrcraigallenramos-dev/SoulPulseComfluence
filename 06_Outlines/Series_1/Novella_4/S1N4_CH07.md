Logline: On the activation platform, Jhace aligns Form conduits to focus the gate's power, risking self-fracture as cosmic equations anchor to his soul.

Beats:
- Pillars of crystalline rune converge; he whispers Form into each, synchronizing their pulses.
- The gate hums to life, warp-shadows pouring from the aperture.
- Conduit feedback scars his flesh; each pulse writes arcane equations on his skin.
- Tiffani steadies his mind with breath-knots; they share a last, silent vow before the final alignment.
- Exit: the gate's geometry locks into place, and reality quivers on its hinges.
