Logline: Tracking Xilcore's rituals, Jhace descends into the crypt, racing to recalibrate a destabilizing vault before the gate tears itself open.

Beats:
- Crypt corridors echo with groans of living stone; Form whispers carve protective wards in brittle columns.
- Vault door pulses in counterpoint to Xilcore's heartbeat; Jhace sets tuning nodes to shift its resonance away from planar collapse.
- Each node costs a shard of breathâ€”his lungs burn as time fractures around him.
- The final node locks with a pulse that nearly crushes his ribs; the vault stutters, then stills.
- Exit: coated in dust, he hears Xilcore's voice in the walls, promising revelation at a terrible price.
