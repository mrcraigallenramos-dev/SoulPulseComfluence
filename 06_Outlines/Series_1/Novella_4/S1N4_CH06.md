Logline: Tiffani confronts Morr with forbidden knowledgeâ€”her coup to wrest control of the gate's activation from the Guild's fanatics.

Beats:
- Council tablets glow as she projects the Gatekeeper Protocol; faces of elders blanch with fear and awe.
- Morr's steel calm cracks; he warns her of consequences beyond mortal reckoning.
- Tiffani counters with Wholeness chains, binding council members in empathy-fueled truth.
- Morr concedes controlâ€”but only if she pledges loyalty to the Protocol's cosmic balance.
- Exit: oath whispered, she realizes she's sealed her fate as the gate's living key.
