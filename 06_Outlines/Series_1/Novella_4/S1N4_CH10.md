Logline: Jhace stands at the Gate's threshold as cosmic forces converge, his Form resonance the final lock, but reality itself fights back.

Beats:
- The gate's aperture stretches across half the sky; Form energy arcs like lightning between conduits.
- Equations pulse in his skin; each breath codes new fractal patterns into existence.
- Reality resistsâ€”shapes shimmer and rewrite, testing his willpower and physical limits.
- Tiffani's empathy strand anchors him, but each knot frays as cosmic entropy bites.
- Exit: with a final whisper, the Gate clicks openâ€”or cracks wideâ€”tearing the world's edges.
