Logline: Tiffani conducts a Wholeness reversal ritual, absorbing the Counter-Spark's lament, but each breath tears deeper into her own equilibrium.

Beats:
- Candlelight flickers on relief-carved walls; Tiffani inscribes inverted glyphs with a trembling hand.
- She anchors the gate's sorrow into a breath-thread, feeling centuries of cosmic grief flood her veins.
- The chamber's air ripples with empathyâ€”each inhale draws in a fragment of destruction, defying her cost-limits.
- As the last rune seals, her tears bloom into motes of luminescence, binding the portal's pain into her flesh.
- Collapse: she staggers out, clutching her chest, whispering a vow to undo what she has become.
