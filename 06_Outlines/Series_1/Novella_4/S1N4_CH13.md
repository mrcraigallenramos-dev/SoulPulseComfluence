Logline: The Gate stabilizes but leaves a scar across realityâ€”Jhace and Tiffani return to a changed world and must decide what to rebuild and what to forget.

Beats:
- The Gate's echo lingers in stones; reality stitches itself with visible seams.
- Survivors wander through half-real landscapes where dreams and code overlap.
- Jhace and Tiffani survey the damageâ€”homes unmelted, people unmade, choices irreversible.
- They vow to tend the scars, each touch costing a memory of what was before.
- Final: they step away hand in hand, the Gate silent behind them, the world reborn from its ashes.
