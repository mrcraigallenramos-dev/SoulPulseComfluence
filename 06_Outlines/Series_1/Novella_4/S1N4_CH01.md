Logline: Jhace scouts the newly sealed Hollowgate portal, discovering it hums with residual Counter-Spark energy that defies Guild purification.

Beats:
- The Gatehouse's stonework pulses with living veinsâ€”Form whispers stabilize runes, but each repair costs a memory of where "home" used to be.
- Inside, gravity tilts unexpectedly; Jhace leaps across inverted pillars to reach the sealed arch, Form shaping broken keystones back into place.
- A whisper of counter-energy trembles through marble floorsâ€”he senses patterns in the tremor, as if the gate itself is breathing.
- He places a stabilized tuning fork at the threshold; the tone fractures the barrier, revealing a shifting vista of impossible geometry.
- Exit: the fork hums in his pack, and he realizes Morr wants this living portal channeled, not destroyed.
