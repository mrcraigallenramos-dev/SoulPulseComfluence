Logline: Vael triggers controlled collapses to reroute reality fractures, buying time but sacrificing urban infrastructure in a desperate balance.

Beats:
- She ignites fracture charges at weak nodes; collapse chokes streets into predetermined channels.
- Each sacrifice stabilizes a larger district; the city's skeleton shifts under cascading strain.
- Resistance forces rally survivors along her safe corridors, praising her as both savior and executioner.
- The Gate's voice echoes in her mindâ€”divine calculus demanding equal exchange.
- Exit: survivors gather around her blade, hope and horror entwined.
