Logline: Official recognition comes with ceremony, credentials, and a social web of obligations that feels like silk becoming steel around their necks.

Beats:
- The certification ceremony is more ritual than bureaucracyâ€”vows to "preserve systemic integrity" and "prioritize collective harmony over individual deviation."
- Fellow certified tuners welcome them with smiles that don't quite mask territorial calculation; they're entering an established hierarchy.
- Jhace is genuinely moved by the respect and belonging; Tiffani notes how the vows could be twisted to justify almost anything.
- New privileges include protected housing, Guild healthcare, and social standingâ€”everything they've never had, contingent on continued cooperation.
- Private moment: Tiffani almost confesses her growing unease, then watches Jhace's face shine with legitimate pride and keeps her doubts locked away.
