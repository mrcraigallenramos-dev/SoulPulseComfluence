Logline: Vael tracks the Debug assignments and realizes they're not random repairsâ€”they're surgical strikes removing system redundancies, making the city more fragile.

Beats:
- The Bone Blade vibrates with each "success," cataloging the micro-fractures their interventions leave in the city's stability matrix.
- Pattern analysis: every Debug mission removes adaptive flexibility, forcing systems toward brittle efficiency that optimizes for control.
- Vael's dilemma crystallizesâ€”they're genuinely helping people in the short term while systematically undermining the city's resilience.
- She begins preparing contingency plans: evacuation routes, emergency supplies, and a list of critical infrastructure to protect when everything collapses.
- Decision point: warn them directly and reveal herself, or continue surveillance until she understands the full scope of Morr's design.
