Logline: Reality hiccups in the marketâ€”gravity flows sideways, colors taste like metalâ€”and their attempt to fix it reveals something is watching their every move.

Beats:
- Atmospheric disturbance manifests as localized physics drift: produce floats, shadows fall upward, time stutters in three-second loops.
- Joint intervention: Jhace stabilizes spatial geometry while Tiffani calms mass hysteria, working in perfect synchronization despite the dimensional flux.
- Mid-repair, they both feel observedâ€”not by crowds but by something vast and patient, cataloging their techniques with clinical interest.
- The disturbance resolves, but residual traces suggest it was artificially generatedâ€”a test or demonstration rather than natural phenomenon.
- Report to Morr feels like confession; his satisfied nod confirms their growing suspicion that they're specimens as much as agents.
