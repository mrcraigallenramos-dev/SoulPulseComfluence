Logline: A cascade failure threatens to shatter every gear in the Ironworks; Jhace must attempt Harmony-tier Form work while Tiffani holds the workers' terror at bay.

Beats:
- The failure spreads like musical discordâ€”each breaking gear triggers three more in geometric progression toward total collapse.
- Jhace extends his Form sense into distributed synchronization, guiding dozens of gears into resonant harmony over several minutes instead of seconds.
- Cost escalation: sustained Harmony work leaves him hollow-eyed and shaking, bones aching like old breaks, but the works sing in perfect time.
- Tiffani weaves crowd-scale Wholeness, absorbing and redistributing panic across hundreds of minds until collective fear becomes cautious hope.
- Success earns them a bonus from Morr and recognition from the Guild; the golden cage door swings wider, inviting them deeper inside.
