Logline: A cascade failure in water treatment threatens thousands; Jhace pushes beyond Harmony into dangerous territory while Tiffani holds the social fabric together by force of will.

Beats:
- The failure spreads through interconnected treatment systems like dominoes falling in slow motionâ€”Jhace must coordinate repairs across miles of infrastructure.
- He extends Form resonance to its limits, synchronizing with dozens of treatment plants simultaneously while the effort burns through his reserves.
- Tiffani manages city-wide panic through distributed Wholeness work, absorbing terror and redistributing calm across population centers until she bleeds from overextension.
- Success prevents catastrophe but leaves them both hollowed out and wondering if they've just proven how indispensable they've become.
- Morr's debrief feels like performance review; they realize their "emergency response" was likely another orchestrated test of their capabilities and limits.
