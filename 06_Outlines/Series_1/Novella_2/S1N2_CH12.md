Logline: Vael's warning creates fractures between them; Jhace clings to the dream of belonging while Tiffani sees the trap closingâ€”but neither can bear to lose what they've built together.

Beats:
- First serious fight: Jhace accuses Tiffani of paranoia and ingratitude; she accuses him of willful blindness and enabling oppression.
- The argument reveals deeper fearsâ€”his terror of returning to irrelevance, her guilt at manipulating him into the relationship that made manipulation possible.
- Physical comfort becomes desperate reassurance; they make love like drowning people, clinging to connection while external pressures threaten to tear them apart.
- Compromise reached: they'll investigate Vael's claims privately while maintaining their Guild obligationsâ€”buying time to find a third option between compliance and rebellion.
- Sleep brings nightmares of choice: save the city or save each other, be heroes or be together, do what's right or do what's possible.
