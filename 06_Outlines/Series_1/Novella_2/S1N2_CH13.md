Logline: Morr assigns them to "Phase Two"â€”a permanent posting that will give them everything they want while ensuring they can never leave the golden cage.

Beats:
- Phase Two briefing reveals the scope of their success: permanent Guild positions, substantial salaries, social status, and authority over other Debug teams.
- The assignment is perfectâ€”everything Jhace has dreamed of, everything Tiffani knows will destroy them both by making them complicit in systematic oppression.
- Morr's offer includes marriage benefits, family planning support, and generational Guild membershipâ€”they're not just being recruited, they're being bred.
- Tiffani realizes this is the moment Vael warned aboutâ€”accept and become willing collaborators, refuse and face elimination or forced compliance.
- Final beat: she takes Jhace's hand and accepts the assignment, buying time while her mind races toward the terrible choice she'll have to make in Novella 1.5.
