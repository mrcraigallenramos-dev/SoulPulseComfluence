Logline: Success makes them reckless; they celebrate with wine, confession, and the dangerous luxury of skin against skin without the world ending.

Beats:
- Post-mission decompression over stolen wine; Jhace admits he's never felt this competent, this useful, this seen.
- Tiffani confesses her fear that she's too good at reading people, at manipulating outcomesâ€”is their partnership real or constructed?
- Physical comfort evolves into need; first time together is clumsy, intense, and tenderâ€”bodies learning trust that minds already know.
- Afterwards, wrapped in shared warmth, they promise again to warn each other before doing anything stupid.
- Camera pulls back: Vael watching from across the courtyard, Bone Blade silent but ready.
