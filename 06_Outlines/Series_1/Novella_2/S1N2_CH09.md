Logline: Guild archives reveal the Debug program's historyâ€”twenty years of "system optimization" that correlates precisely with increasing social unrest and infrastructure fragility.

Beats:
- Archive access requires Guild credentials; Tiffani researches alone while Jhace handles a routine recalibration assignment.
- Historical data shows Debug operations began after the last major uprising, designed to prevent "systemic cascade failures" through preemptive intervention.
- Statistical analysis reveals the terrible truth: Debug missions haven't prevented failuresâ€”they've made the city more dependent on continuous intervention.
- Each "success" removes adaptive redundancy, creating single points of failure that require Guild expertise to maintain; it's addiction disguised as medicine.
- Tiffani realizes she's been complicit in systematic weakening disguised as healingâ€”and they're too valuable to the system now to be allowed to quit.
