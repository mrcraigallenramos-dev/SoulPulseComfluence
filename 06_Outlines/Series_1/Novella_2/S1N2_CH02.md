Logline: A Rot bloom writhes through silk looms, and Tiffani discovers her Wholeness can't heal what's already chosen to dieâ€”some systems want to break.

Beats:
- The bloom pulses like a diseased heart, turning silk to corrosive mesh while workers evacuate in patterns that feel too practiced.
- Jhace attempts Form stabilization; fractures seal briefly before reopening with interest, teaching them limits of opposing pure entropy.
- Tiffani tries Wholeness integration, absorbing the bloom's "loneliness" and discovering it's not maliciousâ€”it's mourning something lost.
- They choose controlled demolition over forced healing, collapsing the infected section cleanly while preserving the healthy mill.
- Payment from Morr includes Guild-certified credentials; the trap's gilding grows thicker with each legitimate success.
