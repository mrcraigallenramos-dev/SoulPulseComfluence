Logline: Progress exceeds projectionsâ€”the subjects have bonded beyond manipulation, which makes them more useful and more dangerous than anticipated.

Beats:
- The room catalogues Phase Two success metrics: social integration complete, skill development optimal, emotional dependency established.
- Notation: the female subject shows concerning pattern recognition regarding systemic manipulationâ€”monitor closely, prepare containment protocols.
- Assessment of the male subject: genuine conviction makes him ideal for public legitimacy, but also creates unpredictability if disillusionment occurs.
- Strategic decision: accelerate timeline for final positioningâ€”the longer they remain capable of independent thought, the greater the risk of defection.
- Final calculation: "Engagement optimal. Proceed to harvest phase." The room dims, and the quiet bells begin their countdown toward Novella 1.5's inevitable betrayal.
