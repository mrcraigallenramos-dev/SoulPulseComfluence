Logline: In their new Guild quarters, bodies seek comfort while minds wrestle with the growing certainty that they're being prepared for something larger than repair work.

Beats:
- The dormitory is comfortable, surveilled, and subtly isolatingâ€”designed to make them dependent on Guild community while limiting outside contact.
- Physical intimacy deepens into emotional vulnerability; they share childhood fears, dreams of worthiness, and the weight of finally mattering to someone.
- Pillow talk turns to operational doubts: why are Debug missions always time-sensitive, why does Morr never explain context, why does success feel hollow?
- They agree to investigate privately, carefullyâ€”still honoring their promise to warn each other before doing anything dangerous.
- Sleep comes uneasily; both dream of being watched by patient eyes that catalog every breath, every heartbeat, every moment of human connection.
