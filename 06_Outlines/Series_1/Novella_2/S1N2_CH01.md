Logline: The DEBUG shard leads them to a room that shouldn't exist, where Father Morr waits with a proposition that sounds like salvation and tastes like trap.

Beats:
- The vault materializes from architectural impossibilityâ€”walls that fold through themselves, gravity as suggestionâ€”while Jhace's Form sense screams wrongness.
- Father Morr introduces himself with clinical warmth, explaining "systemic inefficiencies" and offering them legitimate work debugging reality's edge cases.
- Tiffani masks her recognition behind skeptical questions while cataloging Morr's tells and the vault's quantum-folded spaces.
- First assignment: a Rot bloom in the Textile District that's "refusing treatment"â€”payment in Guild credentials and amnesty for unlicensed tuning.
- Exit: handshake with Morr feels like signing in blood; Tiffani's smile doesn't reach her eyes.
