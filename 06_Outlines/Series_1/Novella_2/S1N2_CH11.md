Logline: Vael breaks cover to warn them directly, revealing the scope of their manipulationâ€”but they're too deep in the golden cage to believe escape is possible.

Beats:
- Vael intercepts them after the water treatment emergency, Bone Blade resonating with their exhaustion and growing systemic entanglement.
- Direct revelation: the Debug program is systematic weakening disguised as strengthening; they're removing the city's immune system to make it dependent on Guild intervention.
- She shows them the pattern dataâ€”every "success" correlates with increased fragility, social dependency, and authoritarian control consolidation.
- Jhace's denial clashes with Tiffani's growing certainty; he can't accept that their meaningful work is actually malicious manipulation.
- Stalemate: Vael offers extraction and protection, but they're not ready to abandon their new lifeâ€”the cage is too comfortable, the alternatives too uncertain.
