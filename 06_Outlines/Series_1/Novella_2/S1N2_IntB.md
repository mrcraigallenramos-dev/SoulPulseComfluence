Logline: Salee's shelter network evolves into an intelligence operation; she trades food and safety for information, building a shadow map of the city's pressure points.

Beats:
- The network has grown beyond charity into mutual aid with teethâ€”safe houses, message drops, and favors owed across all social strata.
- Information flows both ways: she protects the vulnerable while cataloging which systems are failing, which authorities are overextended, where cracks appear.
- A contact mentions the Debug operations and their Guild certification; Salee recognizes the pattern as elite recruitment masquerading as civil service.
- She begins positioning assets near critical infrastructure, not to control but to cushion the inevitable collapse when the current power structure fails.
- The broken locket pulses warm against her chest; she's learned to listen to its rhythm as it guides her toward necessary alliances and away from pretty lies.
