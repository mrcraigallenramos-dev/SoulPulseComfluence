Logline: Vael coordinates with Salee's resistance network to expose the Debug program's true scope, but discovers Guild countermeasures run deeper than anticipated.

Beats:
- Safe house meeting reveals the full network: dozens of cities, hundreds of Debug teams, all following the same systematic weakening protocols disguised as maintenance.
- Intelligence sharing exposes the Guild's harvest timelineâ€”Gate resonance must be extracted within days or the opportunity vanishes forever.
- Bone Blade resonance reveals Guild operatives have infiltrated the resistance network; some allies are double agents, others are unwitting pawns.
- Vael presents evidence of the Debug manipulation to network leaders, but realizes the scope makes it almost impossible to believe or act upon.
- Strategic decision: focus on protecting Jhace and Tiffani as individuals rather than stopping the Guild's continental operation, which may be too large to prevent.
