Logline: Jhace awakens to a city rebuilt wrongâ€”familiar streets run in impossible directions while Tiffani's behavior grows increasingly distant and guilt-ridden.

Beats:
- Morning light reveals architecture that folds through dimensions; buildings remember their pre-Gate forms while existing in new geometries.
- Jhace attempts routine Form maintenance but finds the scarred reality resists his whispers, requiring painful adaptation.
- Tiffani deflects his questions about her sleepless nights and frequent Guild "consultations" with brittle humor.
- A child's drawing shows the Gate as a wound in the sky, bleeding starsâ€”Jhace realizes they've become symbols of something larger than they understand.
- Exit: Tiffani receives an encrypted Guild message and lies about its contents, her first conscious betrayal of their promise.
