Logline: Tiffani meets her original handler and learns the final truthâ€”she was recruited specifically to manipulate Jhace, and now she must choose between mission completion and personal loyalty.

Beats:
- The secure chamber exists in folded space, invisible to normal perception; her handler appears unchanged despite months of cosmic upheaval.
- Full revelation: every moment of their relationship was orchestrated, from their first meeting to their partnership development, all designed to create optimal emotional leverage.
- Her handler shows recordings of her pre-recruitment psychological profile and the manipulation techniques she unconsciously deployed throughout their relationship.
- Final assignment: use Jhace's trust to access the Gate's residual resonance patterns for Guild harvesting operations.
- Internal conflict peaks as she realizes she genuinely loves him while simultaneously being the architect of his exploitation and potential destruction.
