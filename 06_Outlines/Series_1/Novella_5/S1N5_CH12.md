Logline: Despite their shattered trust, Jhace and Tiffani must work together to prevent total collapse while Guild operatives move to complete the harvest operation.

Beats:
- Tiffani arrives with stolen Guild intelligence as infrastructure failures accelerate beyond containment; professional necessity overrides personal betrayal.
- Reluctant partnership as they coordinate Form and Wholeness to stabilize critical systems while avoiding Guild harvest traps.
- Working rhythm returns despite emotional devastation; their professional competence transcends personal destruction.
- Guild operatives attempt to force Jhace into deeper resonance by threatening civilian casualties, requiring Tiffani to choose between his safety and mission objectives.
- Temporary reconciliation as shared purpose and mutual competence create space for cooperation despite the fundamental damage to their relationship.
