Logline: Guild handlers give Tiffani final orders to complete Jhace's psychological preparation for the harvest phase, but she chooses rebellion over compliance.

Beats:
- Final briefing reveals the harvest requires Jhace's willing participation, achieved through either continued manipulation or coercive leverage.
- Guild contingency plans include threats to civilian populations if Tiffani fails to secure his cooperation through psychological pressure.
- Tiffani realizes her confession to Jhace, intended as redemption, has actually provided the Guild with perfect emotional leverage over both of them.
- Choice crystallizes: complete the mission and preserve her own position while destroying Jhace, or refuse and face Guild punishment along with civilian casualties.
- Decision: she chooses active rebellion, stealing Guild intelligence and preparing to warn both Jhace and the resistance network despite personal consequences.
