Logline: Jhace confronts Tiffani with evidence of systematic manipulation, and she finally confesses her roleâ€”destroying their relationship but potentially saving his life and soul.

Beats:
- Jhace presents his infrastructure analysis with hurt confusion, still hoping she can provide an innocent explanation for the systematic deception.
- Tiffani's defenses crumble as she realizes continued lies will only deepen the betrayal; confession becomes her only path to redemption.
- Full revelation: their meeting was arranged, their partnership was cultivated, every major decision was influenced by her Guild training in empathic manipulation.
- Jhace's reaction cycles through disbelief, anger, and profound grief as he realizes the relationship that gave his life meaning was built on systematic exploitation.
- Tiffani's desperate attempt to separate her genuine feelings from her professional manipulation fails as Jhace recognizes how thoroughly his trust has been violated.
