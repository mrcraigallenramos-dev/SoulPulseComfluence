Logline: The harvest operation's disruption exceeds acceptable parameters, but creates new opportunities for longer-term manipulation through reconstruction dependency.

Beats:
- Assessment: primary objectives failed due to subject rebellion and external interference, but secondary objectives achieved through infrastructure damage.
- Analysis of subject behavioral patterns reveals manipulation techniques require adjustment for future operations in similar population centers.
- Counter-Spark interference noted as significant variable requiring enhanced containment protocols in subsequent phases.
- Strategic pivot: reconstruction operations will create deeper dependency relationships than original harvesting plan, extending timeline but improving control.
- Final notation: "Subjects demonstrated resistance to total manipulation. Recommend graduated approach for remaining phases." The room dims, plans already adapting.
