Logline: Vael leads a coordinated assault on the Guild harvesting facility while Jhace and Tiffani work to prevent city-wide collapse from the inside.

Beats:
- Multi-pronged attack: resistance cells target infrastructure nodes while Vael infiltrates the central harvesting facility using Bone Blade resonance.
- Guild defenses include both technological security and empathic manipulation fields designed to turn attackers against each other.
- Bone Blade cuts through reality distortions to reach the harvesting core, but destroying it will eliminate both Guild control and city stability.
- Coordination with Jhace and Tiffani through resistance communication networks allows precise timing of destruction and stabilization operations.
- Victory comes with enormous cost: Guild operations ended but city infrastructure permanently damaged, requiring complete reconstruction of social and technical systems.
