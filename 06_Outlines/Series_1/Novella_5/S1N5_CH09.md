Logline: Vael attempts to extract both Jhace and Tiffani before the Guild's final phase, but discovers their psychological states make cooperation nearly impossible.

Beats:
- Bone Blade guides her to Jhace's location, but his emotional instability has created Form distortions that make approach dangerous.
- Attempt to explain the larger conspiracy fails as Jhace's trust in external authority has been completely shattered by Tiffani's betrayal.
- Tiffani's Guild conditioning wars with her desire to escape, creating internal contradictions that manifest as empathic feedback loops.
- Vael realizes extraction requires healing the relationship between them, but their mutual betrayal and hurt may be insurmountable.
- Strategic retreat as Guild operatives converge on their location, forcing Vael to choose between immediate rescue and long-term liberation.
