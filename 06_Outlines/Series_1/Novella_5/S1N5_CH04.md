Logline: Jhace assists with Guild "resonance stabilization" in the Gate chamber, unaware he's enabling the very harvesting operation that will drain the city's adaptive resilience.

Beats:
- The resonance chamber hums with contained Gate energy; Jhace synchronizes Form patterns with harvesting equipment he believes is designed for stabilization.
- Technical briefing explains "energy redistribution" for continental grid stability, all true but concealing the underlying purpose of systematic dependency creation.
- Form work requires deeper engagement than previous operations; Jhace approaches Overtone threshold while maintaining precise harmonic patterns.
- Tiffani monitors his biometrics and emotional state, providing Wholeness support while secretly gathering data on his maximum operational capacity.
- Success creates the first stable Gate resonance tap, but Jhace feels something fundamental has changed in the city's underlying harmony.
