Logline: Alone and emotionally shattered, Jhace processes the scope of his manipulation while Form whispers become unstable, threatening his connection to reality itself.

Beats:
- Isolation in their shared apartment becomes psychological torture as every object holds memories of manufactured intimacy and calculated affection.
- Form work becomes erratic as emotional trauma disrupts his resonance; simple stabilization attempts trigger dangerous feedback loops.
- Review of their relationship through the lens of manipulation reveals the sophisticated emotional engineering that shaped every major decision and feeling.
- Rage and grief war with his core nature as someone who wants to help and heal, creating internal contradictions that threaten his psychological integrity.
- Recognition that his anger endangers others leads to voluntary isolation, but solitude only amplifies the sense of profound betrayal and manufactured love.
