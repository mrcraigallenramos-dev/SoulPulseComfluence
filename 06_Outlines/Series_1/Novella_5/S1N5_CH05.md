Logline: Domestic intimacy becomes torture as Tiffani struggles to maintain normal interaction while knowing she's systematically betraying everything meaningful in their relationship.

Beats:
- Morning routine feels like performance art; she monitors her responses to ensure authentic emotional displays while internally calculating manipulation outcomes.
- Jhace shares his concerns about the city's changing harmony and asks for her empathic reading of the population's psychological state.
- She provides accurate analysis while omitting her knowledge of the systematic manipulation causing the very distress patterns she's describing.
- Physical intimacy becomes painful as genuine desire wars with professional obligation; every touch feels like theft.
- Breaking point approaches as she realizes continued deception will destroy both their relationship and her own psychological integrity.
