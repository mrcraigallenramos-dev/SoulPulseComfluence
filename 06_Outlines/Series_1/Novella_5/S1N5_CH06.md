Logline: Investigating reports of infrastructure instability, Jhace discovers the harvesting operation's true effectsâ€”systematic removal of adaptive redundancy that will cause total collapse within days.

Beats:
- Grid analysis reveals concerning patterns: backup systems offline, redundancy networks simplified to single points of failure, all justified by "efficiency optimization."
- Form resonance with infrastructure shows the harvesting operation has drained the city's ability to adapt to unexpected stress or system failures.
- Jhace realizes the Guild's "stabilization" work has created a perfectly vulnerable system that will collapse catastrophically under any significant pressure.
- Technical evidence confirms what his intuition has been suggesting: they haven't been maintaining the city, they've been preparing it for controlled demolition.
- Confrontation decision: he must confront Tiffani with his findings, not knowing she's been complicit in the very manipulation he's just discovered.
