Logline: Salee coordinates the resistance network's response to the impending collapse, but realizes saving the city may require sacrificing the individuals who've become symbols of hope.

Beats:
- Network analysis confirms Guild timeline: total infrastructure collapse within 48 hours, followed by "emergency reconstruction" under authoritarian control.
- Resistance cells are positioned to maintain essential services and protect vulnerable populations, but success requires enormous personal sacrifice.
- Intelligence reveals Jhace and Tiffani's location and psychological states; they've become liabilities to both Guild and resistance operations.
- Strategic calculation: their symbolic value as Guild manipulation victims versus their actual utility in preventing city-wide catastrophe.
- Salee's locket pulses with increasing urgency, guiding her toward choices that will define not just survival but the moral foundation of post-collapse society.
