Logline: City systems begin failing in cascade as the harvest operation destabilizes infrastructure, forcing Jhace to choose between helping people and protecting himself from Guild exploitation.

Beats:
- First failures appear manageable: power fluctuations, water pressure drops, communication static, all within normal emergency parameters.
- Cascade acceleration reveals the systematic nature: each failure triggers multiple others in patterns that suggest artificial orchestration rather than natural breakdown.
- Jhace's instinct to help conflicts with knowledge of his manipulation; Form work to stabilize systems plays directly into Guild harvesting operations.
- Recognition that helping people requires entering dangerous resonance states that will provide the Guild with the very energy patterns they need.
- Moral choice: allow suffering through inaction or risk personal exploitation to provide immediate relief, knowing both choices serve Guild objectives.
