Logline: Supervising junior Debug teams forces Tiffani to teach the manipulation techniques that trapped her, making her complicit in expanding the system she's grown to hate.

Beats:
- Training session with eager junior operatives who remind her of herself and Jhace months agoâ€”competent, grateful, and completely unaware of the trap.
- Tiffani teaches advanced Wholeness techniques for crowd management, watching young faces light up with the same pride that once motivated her.
- Demonstration assignment goes perfectly: juniors successfully "optimize" a community dispute, removing local conflict resolution in favor of Guild mediation.
- Private conversation with a junior operative who thanks her for the opportunity to "really help people" drives the knife of complicity deeper.
- That night, she stares at her reflection and practices the words she'll never say: "We need to run. Tonight."
