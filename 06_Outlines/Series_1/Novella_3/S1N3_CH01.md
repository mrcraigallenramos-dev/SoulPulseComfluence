Logline: Phase Two orientation reveals their new authority over other Debug teams and the crushing weight of complicity in systematic control disguised as public service.

Beats:
- Guild Tower tour shows the scope of their operationâ€”hundreds of Debug teams across dozens of cities, all following the same brittle optimization protocols.
- Jhace meets other Phase Two operatives: competent, comfortable, and completely convinced they're saving civilization through technical expertise.
- Authorization briefing grants them oversight of junior teams, making them complicit in training the next generation of unwitting collaborators.
- Tiffani watches Jhace's genuine excitement at being trusted with responsibility and feels the weight of her growing deception.
- Private moment: she almost confesses everything, then sees his pride and pushes the truth deeper underground.
