Logline: Vael tracks Debug operations across multiple cities and discovers the full scopeâ€”a continent-wide system of controlled dependency preparing for something larger than social control.

Beats:
- Bone Blade resonance reveals the network: dozens of cities following identical optimization patterns, all building toward synchronized vulnerability.
- Intelligence gathering shows the timeline: every city reaches critical brittleness within months of each other, creating a continental cascade point.
- Vael realizes the Guild isn't just controlling citiesâ€”they're preparing for controlled collapse and reconstruction under complete authoritarian oversight.
- Counter-intelligence reveals her own surveillance has been detected; Guild operatives know about the Auditor and are preparing countermeasures.
- Strategic decision: direct intervention is now necessary, but it will expose her fully and force a confrontation she may not survive.
