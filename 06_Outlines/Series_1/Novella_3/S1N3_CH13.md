Logline: The first infrastructure attacks begin exactly as planned, with Jhace and Tiffani responding heroically to threats they don't realize are artificial, while communication blackout ensures their isolation.

Beats:
- First cascade begins in distant sectorsâ€”textbook failures that trigger their trained responses while hiding the artificial nature of the attacks.
- Jhace coordinates emergency stabilization with Form resonance while Tiffani manages information flow to prevent panic, both working exactly as trained.
- Communication systems fail "due to overload," isolating them from outside confirmation while Guild strike teams continue systematic infrastructure destruction.
- Tiffani recognizes the pattern from her archive researchâ€”too precise, too convenient, too perfectly timed to be natural failure, but Jhace is too focused on response to listen.
- Chapter ends with them working in perfect coordination to fight a disaster they don't realize is orchestrated, while outside the facility, the real catastrophe begins to unfold.
