Logline: Physical and emotional intimacy reach new depths while the weight of their secrets threatens to tear them apartâ€”love and lies intertwined beyond separation.

Beats:
- Post-crisis vulnerability leads to their deepest physical intimacy yetâ€”bodies and souls seeking connection while external pressures mount.
- Jhace confesses his fear of the power he felt during the cascade, how easy it would be to lose himself in god-scale capabilities.
- Tiffani almost breaks, nearly confessing her role in the manipulation, but sees his trust and vulnerability and can't destroy it.
- They make love with desperate tenderness, each trying to save the other from truths they can't voice.
- Afterwards, holding each other in the dark, both silently prepare for choices they hope they'll never have to make.
