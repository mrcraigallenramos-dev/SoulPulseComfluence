Logline: Advanced protocols briefing reveals the Guild's endgameâ€”continental reconstruction following planned collapse, with Debug teams as the architects of a new authoritarian order.

Beats:
- Classified briefing shows the full timeline: synchronized city failures followed by Guild-managed "emergency reconstruction" under martial law.
- Jhace and Tiffani's role in the new order: regional commanders overseeing reconstruction efforts, with broad authority over civilian populations.
- The presentation frames it as preventing chaos and saving lives, using their genuine desire to help people as justification for accepting dictatorship.
- Jhace asks thoughtful questions about civilian welfare; Tiffani recognizes the same caring manipulation that recruited them originally.
- Meeting ends with assignment to "transition protocols"â€”they have weeks to prepare for their role in orchestrated collapse and subsequent authoritarian takeover.
