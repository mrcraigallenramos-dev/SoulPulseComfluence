Logline: Transition protocols training teaches them to manage civilian populations during "emergency reconstruction"â€”crowd control disguised as public safety, authoritarianism justified by crisis.

Beats:
- Training scenarios simulate post-collapse civilian management: resource distribution, work assignment, and "social stability maintenance" through controlled information flow.
- Jhace learns to coordinate Form-based infrastructure control with social engineering, making technical systems dependent on Guild oversight.
- Role-playing exercises have them practice explaining emergency measures to frightened civilians, using empathy and competence to sell voluntary subjugation.
- Tiffani watches herself become expert at reading crowd psychology for manipulation rather than healing, each success feeling like spiritual death.
- Training concludes with commendations for their natural leadership abilities and assignments to high-priority transition zones when "conditions necessitate implementation."
