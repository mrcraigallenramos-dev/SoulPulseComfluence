Logline: Salee's network evolves from mutual aid into organized resistance as she prepares for the collapse she can feel approaching through every social pressure point.

Beats:
- Intelligence from her network confirms what she's suspected: the Guild's "optimization" is systematic weakening disguised as improvement.
- Resource stockpiling beginsâ€”food, medicine, tools, and safe spaces distributed across the city in preparation for infrastructure failure.
- Key contacts are identified and cultivated: engineers who understand real redundancy, medics who prioritize people over protocols, leaders who choose community over control.
- The broken locket pulses with increasing urgency, its warmth becoming almost painful as it guides her toward choices that will define survival or extinction.
- Final preparation: she begins recruiting not followers but partnersâ€”people ready to rebuild from the ashes without repeating the mistakes that led to systematic dependency.
