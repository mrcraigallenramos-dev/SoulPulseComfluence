Logline: Vael takes position around the facility perimeter as the timeline accelerates, forcing her final choice between extraction and allowing events to play out toward the inevitable confrontation.

Beats:
- Perimeter surveillance reveals Guild strike teams positioned to execute infrastructure attacks while Jhace and Tiffani are isolated inside.
- Bone Blade resonance shows the scope of planned destruction: coordinated strikes across multiple cities designed to create continent-wide cascade failure.
- Counter-Spark presence intensifiesâ€”divine agents moving to exploit the chaos for their own reconstruction agenda, neither human nor Guild-aligned.
- Extraction window closes as facility lockdown begins; any rescue attempt now means fighting through Guild security and risking civilian casualties.
- Vael's final decision: trust them to survive and find their own truth, positioning herself for intervention during the aftermath rather than prevention of the crisis.
