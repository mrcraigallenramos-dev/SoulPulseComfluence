Logline: A citywide infrastructure cascade pushes Jhace to the edge of Overtone Statesâ€”raw power that could solve everything or destroy him, while Tiffani holds his sanity together by force of will.

Beats:
- Cascade failure spreads across power, water, and transport systems simultaneouslyâ€”too complex for normal Debug protocols, requiring unprecedented coordination.
- Jhace extends his Form resonance citywide, touching every major system while the effort burns through his mental defenses and approaches true Overtone threshold.
- Tiffani anchors him through distributed Wholeness, absorbing his fear and pain while maintaining her own grip on dozens of panicking neighborhoods.
- Success prevents total collapse but leaves them both changedâ€”Jhace has tasted god-scale power, Tiffani has held a city's worth of terror without breaking.
- Morr's debrief focuses on their "breakthrough performance" and begins discussing "advanced applications" that sound like weaponization.
