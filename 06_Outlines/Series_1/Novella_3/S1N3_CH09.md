Logline: Pre-deployment briefing assigns them to Ground Zero of the planned collapseâ€”they'll be heroes trying to save the day while unknowingly enabling the very catastrophe they're fighting.

Beats:
- Mission parameters place them at the continental power grid nexus during the "most vulnerable period" of scheduled infrastructure updates.
- They're told their job is preventing cascade failure during maintenance; the truth is their presence legitimizes the planned attacks and provides scapegoats for the consequences.
- Jhace feels honored by the trust and responsibility; Tiffani recognizes it as the perfect setup for manipulation and betrayal.
- Private conversation reveals their growing divergenceâ€”he sees purpose and belonging, she sees trap and exploitation, neither can bridge the gap without breaking the other.
- Final orders include emergency protocols that will isolate them from outside communication during the critical period, ensuring they can't call for help when the truth becomes clear.
