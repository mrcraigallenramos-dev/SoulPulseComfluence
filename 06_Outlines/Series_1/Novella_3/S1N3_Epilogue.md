Logline: All pieces are in position for the final gambitâ€”subjects isolated and committed, infrastructure primed for collapse, and Counter-Spark servants ready to exploit the chaos for competing reconstruction.

Beats:
- Status report confirms optimal positioning: primary assets deployed to Ground Zero, secondary assets managing regional response, public legitimacy maintained through genuine heroic effort.
- Timeline acceleration approvedâ€”continental collapse begins now, while subjects remain psychologically committed to preventing the disaster they're actually enabling.
- Counter-Spark variables noted and acceptedâ€”competing divine agendas will create opportunities for advancement regardless of immediate outcomes.
- Final authorization: proceed to harvest phase, with extraction protocols prepared for valuable assets and elimination protocols for security risks.
- The room dims as countdown beginsâ€”within hours, everything they've built toward will be tested in the crucible of orchestrated catastrophe and genuine human response.
