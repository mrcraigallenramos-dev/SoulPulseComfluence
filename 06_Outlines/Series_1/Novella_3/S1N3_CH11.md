Logline: Deployment to the power grid nexus feels like the culmination of their training and partnership, but subtle wrongness in the setup makes Tiffani increasingly nervous.

Beats:
- The facility is larger and more complex than briefings indicated, with security measures that seem designed to keep people in rather than threats out.
- Technical briefings reveal last-minute changes to protocols and communication procedures, all justified by "enhanced security during critical operations."
- Jhace throws himself into preparation with characteristic competence and enthusiasm, treating it as the most important work of his life.
- Tiffani notices discrepancies between their briefings and the actual facility layout, plus Guild personnel who avoid eye contact and speak in clipped, nervous tones.
- Day shifts to night with them in position, communication links established, and the growing certainty that they're not here to prevent disaster but to provide legitimacy for it.
