Logline: Their last night before deployment becomes a desperate celebration of connection while both struggle with secrets that could destroy everything they've built together.

Beats:
- They make dinner together in their Guild quarters, domestic intimacy tinged with the weight of unspoken knowledge and approaching crisis.
- Jhace talks excitedly about their mission and the good they'll do; Tiffani responds with loving support while dying inside from her complicity and deception.
- Physical intimacy carries desperationâ€”both clinging to connection while fearing it may be their last honest moment together.
- Tiffani drafts a confession letter three times, each version more devastating than the last, then burns them all rather than destroy his trust and joy.
- They fall asleep entangled, each trying to memorize the feeling of safety and love before tomorrow changes everything forever.
