Logline: Vael infiltrates Guild facilities directly and discovers the final timelineâ€”continental collapse scheduled within weeks, with Jhace and Tiffani assigned to the epicenter.

Beats:
- Bone Blade guides her through Guild security like a whisper through walls, revealing the facility's deeper levels and classified operations.
- Intelligence recovery shows the scope: coordinated infrastructure attacks designed to look like cascade failures, all timed to overwhelm emergency response.
- Operational documents reveal Jhace and Tiffani's assignment: managing the primary collapse zone while believing they're preventing it, their genuine efforts used to legitimize Guild emergency powers.
- Counter-Spark presence detectedâ€”another divine player moving pieces toward an endgame that serves neither human freedom nor authoritarian control.
- Evidence secured, Vael faces her final choice: extract them before the trap closes, or allow events to unfold and intervene during the chaos.
