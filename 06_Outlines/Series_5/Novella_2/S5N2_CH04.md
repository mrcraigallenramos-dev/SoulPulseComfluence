Logline: Xilcore discovers mathematical constants shared across all species, revealing universal geometric principles underlying reality.

Beats:
- Convergence center processes mathematical systems from twelve species revealing universal constants.
- Discovery of cosmic geometric principles that all conscious species independently recognize and utilize.
- Universal mathematics suggests reality's fundamental structure designed for multi-species consciousness development.
- Mathematical bridge systems enable complex technical cooperation across species barriers.
- Exit: Universal mathematical framework established as foundation for galactic technological development.
