Logline: Vael coordinates the growing galactic alliance as multiple species join human-alien cooperation, creating unprecedented cosmic democracy.

Beats:
- Hub stations orbit galactic core; representatives from twelve species participate in alliance coordination.
- Translation systems integrate multiple communication methodsâ€”geometric, harmonic, chemical, telepathic.
- Democratic protocols adapt to species with radically different consciousness structures and decision-making processes.
- Alliance charter balances individual species autonomy with collective cosmic responsibility.
- First major vote on galactic resource allocation demonstrates multi-species democracy's potential and challenges.
- Exit: Alliance charter ratified with provision for expanding membership and adaptive governance.
