Logline: Vael coordinates integration of new species joining the alliance, adapting protocols for increasingly diverse membership.

Beats:
- Integration protocols scale to accommodate species with radically different consciousness, biology, and culture.
- New member orientation programs respect species autonomy while explaining alliance principles and benefits.
- Alliance structure adapts to incorporate new perspectives and abilities from expanding membership.
- Integration success measured by new members' contributions to alliance goals rather than conformity.
- Exit: Integration protocols established for continuous alliance expansion across galactic civilization.
