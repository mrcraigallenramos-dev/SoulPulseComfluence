Logline: The Auditor assesses multi-species cooperation stability, adjusting galactic parameters for sustained alliance development.

Beats:
- Alliance cooperation metrics show stable multi-species collaboration with growing complexity.
- Universal principles discovered through cooperation exceed single-species development potential.
- Framework adjustments account for exponential complexity growth from multi-species consciousness interaction.
- Exit: Galactic stability protocols updated for continued alliance expansion and consciousness evolution.
