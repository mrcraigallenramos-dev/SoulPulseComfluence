Logline: Xilcore studies limits of geometry as space warps into non-Euclidean matrices, seeking new universal constants.

Beats:
- Fractal analysis reveals shifting dimensionality.
- Attempts to stabilize grid with higher-order Form signatures.
- Temporary constants discoveredâ€”constantly mutating but locally stable.
- Theory: geometry adapts to observerâ€™s expectations and unity.
- Exit: Satellite beacons anchored, path secured for further travel.
