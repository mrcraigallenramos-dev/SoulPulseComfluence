Logline: Kira pioneers empathic mapping of unknown reality layers, decoding signals that challenge sentient cognition.

Beats:
- Empathic pulses transmitted into the void, feeling for minds or consciousness.
- Feedback loops: alien presence detected but cognition nonlinear.
- Translational synesthesia required to bridge new emotional dimensions.
- Kira develops protocols to maintain unity amongst emotionally disoriented crew.
- Exit: First successful empathic dialogue with nonlocal consciousness.
