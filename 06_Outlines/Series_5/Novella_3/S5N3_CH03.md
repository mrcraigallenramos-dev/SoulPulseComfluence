Logline: Vael coordinates responses to emergent anomalies, balancing risk and exploration as cosmic laws dissolve.

Beats:
- Fracture events: regions with altered causality, time reversals, logic flips.
- Anomaly management teams deploy with adaptive stabilization fields; some fail spectacularly.
- Crew debates risk: knowledge vs. existential danger.
- Vael reinforces consensus: adapt or perish, but never abandon unity.
- Exit: Stabilized corridor secured; odyssey continues farther.
