Logline: Jhace leads the first alliance expedition through the Hypergate to chart realities beyond the known universe, testing cosmic adaptability and unity.

Beats:
- Hypergate activates: resonance arrays align; team readies for unknown.
- Collective send-off: ritual combining all speciesâ€™ stewardship rites.
- First crossing: reality warps, baseline senses distort, team must ground in shared identity.
- Data streams show reality constants fluctuating, requiring constant adaptation.
- Exit: Arrival in unmapped domainâ€”first probe sent; odyssey begins.
