Logline: Leesa oversees the first census, measuring health, joy, and unity across diverging civilizational offshoots.

Beats:
- Empathic pings return from a thousand worlds.
- World-splinters with new cultures, rituals, languages.
- Joy-indices generally high; unity tested in â€œstrange lifespanâ€ timelines.
- Leesaâ€™s adjustments smooth out instabilities.
- Exit: Social health reaffirmed.
