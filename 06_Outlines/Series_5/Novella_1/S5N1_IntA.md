Logline: The Auditor evaluates first contact variables, adjusting cosmic manipulation protocols to maintain experimental integrity during alien interaction.

Beats:
- Probability matrices show 94% likelihood of peaceful contact based on empathic analysis and signal patterns.
- Manipulation parameters adjusted to allow natural first contact development while preventing cascade failures.
- Alien civilization analysis suggests they operate outside current experimental frameworkâ€”independent variables.
- Contact protocols calibrated to preserve authentic human choice while monitoring for manipulation opportunities.
- Exit: Contact phase authorized with minimal interventionâ€”allow natural cultural exchange.
