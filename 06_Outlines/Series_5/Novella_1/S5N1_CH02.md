Logline: Kira develops empathic techniques to sense alien emotional patterns, discovering profound loneliness and ancient grief in the approaching signals.

Beats:
- Monitoring station equipped with enhanced empathic resonance arrays tuned to non-human consciousness patterns.
- Initial readings show complex emotional architecturesâ€”not human-like but recognizably sentient.
- Kira detects deep currents of isolation, loss, and desperate hope for connection across vast cosmic distances.
- Empathic echoes suggest the aliens are last survivors of some cosmic catastrophe seeking kinship.
- Protocol development for empathic first contactâ€”establishing emotional trust before intellectual exchange.
- Training sessions prepare human diplomats for alien emotional patterns that might overwhelm unprepared minds.
- Exit: Kira confirms aliens approach with peaceful intent driven by profound cosmic loneliness.
