Logline: Alien vessels arrive at designated contact site; Vael oversees humanity's first meeting with another intelligent species.

Beats:
- Alien vessels materialize using technology beyond current human understandingâ€”space folding rather than conventional travel.
- First visual contact reveals beings of crystalline energy structureâ€”not biological but clearly conscious and intentional.
- Vael manages security perimeter while ensuring welcoming atmosphereâ€”balance between caution and openness.
- Initial communication attempts using prepared protocolsâ€”mathematical sequences and empathic resonance patterns.
- Aliens respond with complex harmonics suggesting interest in peaceful cultural exchange.
- Exit: First contact successful; formal communication sessions scheduled for extended exchange.
