Logline: Blemo prepares purification protocols for alien contact, ensuring safety while avoiding xenophobic contamination of pure intentions.

Beats:
- Purification systems designed to cleanse potential alien pathogens while respecting alien life forms as inherently valuable.
- Purity protocols balance safety with ethical treatment of alien visitorsâ€”avoiding discriminatory decontamination.
- Testing reveals alien energy signatures compatible with human biologyâ€”no inherent contamination risk detected.
- Blemo develops selective purification maintaining alien cultural signatures while ensuring biological safety.
- Ethical debates over whether purification implies aliens are inherently impureâ€”Blemo argues for mutual adaptation.
- Exit: Purification protocols approved with emphasis on mutual respect and cultural preservation.
