Logline: Kira explores alien emotional architecture, discovering profound differences in feeling and empathy requiring new understanding frameworks.

Beats:
- Exchange center allows careful empathic contact between human and alien consciousness.
- Alien emotions operate through harmonic resonance rather than biochemical processesâ€”music as feeling.
- Kira adapts empathic techniques to interface with harmonic emotional systems.
- Discovery of universal emotional constantsâ€”love, curiosity, hope transcend species boundaries.
- Exit: Empathic bridge established enabling deep emotional understanding between species.
