Logline: Jhace leads first contact protocols as deep space arrays detect structured signals from beyond the galaxy, testing humanity's cosmic maturity.

Beats:
- Observatory platforms orbit beyond Aethelgard's outer moons; hybrid resonance dishes scan cosmic depths.
- Signal analysis reveals mathematical progressions suggesting advanced intelligenceâ€”not random cosmic noise.
- Jhace coordinates with Kira to empathically scan for hostile intent; readings suggest curiosity rather than aggression.
- Form-Wholeness hybrid protocols developed for potential communication bridgingâ€”geometric patterns with empathic undertones.
- First response beams transmitted combining mathematical sequences with emotional resonance signatures.
- Deep ethical debates: whether to reveal human location or maintain observational distance for safety.
- Exit: Response signals detected incomingâ€”first contact appears imminent within solar months.
