Logline: Leesa coordinates empathic preparation for cultural exchange, fostering harmony while respecting fundamental differences between species.

Beats:
- Harmony center trains diplomats in cross-species empathyâ€”understanding without imposing human emotional patterns.
- Cultural exchange protocols emphasize mutual learning rather than conversion or dominance by either species.
- Leesa develops empathic buffers preventing overwhelming emotional feedback during intense cross-species contact.
- Preparation includes meditation practices helping humans maintain identity while opening to alien perspectives.
- Exit: Cultural bridge teams ready to facilitate respectful first contact emphasizing mutual enrichment.
