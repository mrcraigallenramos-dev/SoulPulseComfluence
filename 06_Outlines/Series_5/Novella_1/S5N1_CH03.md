Logline: Vael coordinates global preparation for alien contact, balancing transparency with security while managing public hopes and fears.

Beats:
- Command center integrates reports from observatories, empathic stations, and cultural assessment teams worldwide.
- Public information campaigns prepare populations for first contact without causing panic or unrealistic expectations.
- Security protocols balance welcome preparations with defensive contingencies in case empathic readings prove wrong.
- International consensus building requires delicate negotiation as different cultures propose various contact approaches.
- Resource allocation for contact facilities, translation teams, cultural exchange programs, and emergency responses.
- Intelligence networks monitor for exploitative groups seeking to weaponize alien contact for personal or political gain.
- Exit: Global contact protocols established; humanity presents unified face while maintaining security readiness.
