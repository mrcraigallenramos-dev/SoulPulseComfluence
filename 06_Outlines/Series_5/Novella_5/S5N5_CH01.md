Logline: Jhace oversees the Metacosmic Observatory as infinite realities converge into a unified understanding of existence itself.

Beats:
- Observatory spans dimensions, monitoring countless reality streams simultaneously through hybrid Form-Wholeness arrays.
- Data synthesis reveals universal patterns: all realities following similar consciousness evolution despite different physical laws.
- Jhace coordinates with versions of himself from parallel realities, sharing healing techniques across dimensional barriers.
- Discovery of metacosmic constantsâ€”fundamental principles that govern all possible realities and consciousness development.
- Universal healing protocols developed combining techniques from infinite reality variants, treating existence-level trauma.
- Jhace's role evolves from individual healer to cosmic healing coordinator across all possible worlds.
- Recognition that healing serves not just individuals but reality itself, mending fractures in the fabric of existence.
- Exit: Metacosmic healing network established, ready to address universal consciousness evolution challenges.
