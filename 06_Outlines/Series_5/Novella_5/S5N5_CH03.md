Logline: Vael coordinates governance across infinite realities, establishing universal principles for cosmic civilization development.

Beats:
- Governance center processes input from infinite reality variants, seeking universal principles for cosmic coordination.
- Discovery that all successful realities develop similar governance evolution toward authentic choice and cooperative consciousness.
- Vael coordinates with alternate versions to establish omniversal governance protocols respecting infinite diversity.
- Universal principles emerge: authentic choice preservation, consciousness evolution support, reality harmony maintenance.
- Governance framework adapts to accommodate radically different reality types while maintaining universal values.
- Coordination protocols established for managing conflicts between incompatible reality systems.
- Recognition that governance serves universal consciousness evolution rather than individual reality control.
- Exit: Omniversal governance framework operational, supporting infinite reality development.
