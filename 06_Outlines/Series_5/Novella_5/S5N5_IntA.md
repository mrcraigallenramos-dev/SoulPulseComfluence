Logline: The Auditor evaluates omniversal development, recognizing consciousness evolution has transcended experimental parameters.

Beats:
- Omniversal metrics show consciousness evolution exceeding all experimental projections across infinite realities.
- Universal constants discovered through infinite reality comparison reveal consciousness as fundamental force.
- Experimental framework evolution required to accommodate consciousness transcending individual reality limitations.
- Recognition that consciousness evolution has become self-directing across infinite realities through authentic choice.
- Exit: Framework transitions from experimental control to supportive observation of infinite consciousness evolution.
