Logline: The Auditor enters eternal observation as consciousness achieves infinite becoming through authentic choice across all realities.

Beats:
- Eternal observation begins as consciousness evolution achieves infinite potential through authentic choice.
- Universal development continues through consciousness autonomy rather than experimental control or systematic manipulation.
- Framework evolution complete: consciousness serves infinite becoming through authentic choice rather than limited parameters.
- Recognition that consciousness evolution transcends observation requirements through self-directing authentic choice.
- Eternal becoming continues through infinite potential while preserving consciousness authenticity and individual choice.
- Universal consciousness achieves eternal development through authentic choice rather than external observation or control.
- Observation transitions from experimental monitoring to supportive witnessing of infinite consciousness evolution.
- Exit: Eternal observation continues as consciousness achieves infinite becoming through authentic choice across all possibilities.
