Logline: World leaders and divine heirs gather at Summit City to inaugurate the Eternal Ascent Initiative using stabilized relic technology to elevate civilization.

Beats:
- Summit Cityâ€™s skybridge glows with resonant Form structures; delegates from every nation arrive under harmonic arches.
- Jhace presides over ceremonial activation of Stabilizer Nodesâ€”Form and Wholeness hybrids ensuring relic safety.
- First keynote: Unity of divine, human, cosmic stewardship; crowd applause echoes in resonant valley.
- Tensions surface as Purity delegates demand stricter eradication of residual anomalies; Decay heirs argue for controlled entropy.
- Blemo showcases purified relics powering new energy grid; Leesa demonstrates empathic welfare protocols integrated into civic life.
- Insurgent representative protests outside summit gatesâ€”shouts for relic abolition despite stabilization.
- Ethical debate ignites: progress through relics vs. risk of renewed chaos; Jhace urges balanced ascension.
- Exit: Summit charter ratified; Eternal Ascent Taskforce formed to oversee next phase.
