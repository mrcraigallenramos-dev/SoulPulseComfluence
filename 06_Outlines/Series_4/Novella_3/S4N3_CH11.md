Logline: Consortium council convenes to decide fate of prototype relicsâ€”destroy, store, or weaponizeâ€”revealing deep philosophical rifts.

Beats:
- Destroy argument based on cascade risk; store camp warns knowledge loss; weaponize faction pushes defense edge.
- Heated debate cites historical hubris and current security threats.
- Xilcore proposes triad approach: seal prototypes, study under extreme oversight, and develop defense protocols.
- Exit: Resolution passes 7-5 with strict oversight language.
