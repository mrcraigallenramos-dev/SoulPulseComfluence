Logline: Blemo conducts controlled tests on prototype relics, mapping their time-phase and dimensional effects for safe integration.

Beats:
- Prototype A tested in quantum isolate; Blemo records pulse duration and phasing drift.
- Controlled variable adjustments show stable phase loops under diluted purity pulses.
- Safety cage experiments highlight residual bleed-through risks.
- Exit: Lab report recommends limited use for emergency applications only.
