Logline: Vael refines governance policies based on Alpha City data, implementing adaptive frameworks for floating and ground societies alike.

Beats:
- Data briefs show differing needs: sea cities require maritime protocols, sky cities need air-traffic guidelines.
- Vael drafts modular charters adaptable to local conditions.
- Debates over civic representation and node rotations.
- Exit: Policy modules documented and dispatched to taskforce branches.
