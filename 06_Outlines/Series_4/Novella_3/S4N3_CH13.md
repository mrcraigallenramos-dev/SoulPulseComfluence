Logline: Kira leads post-test empathic cleanses for lab staff, removing subtle psychic residues from prototype exposure.

Beats:
- Sessions integrate relational grounding and reality-affirmation rituals.
- Staff describe vivid glimpses of other timelines; Kira neutralizes cross-temporal echoes.
- Therapeutic protocols refined for future high-risk experiments.
- Exit: Staff cleared; lab ready for next phase under new safety rules.
