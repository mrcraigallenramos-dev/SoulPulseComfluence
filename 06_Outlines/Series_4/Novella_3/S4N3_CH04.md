Logline: Blemo conducts longevity trials on relic-powered biomes, testing ecological purity alongside human health in suspended ecosystems.

Beats:
- Biome domes sustain exotic flora and fauna; purity filters maintain microbe balance.
- Human volunteers report enhanced vitality; blood analyses show cellular rejuvenation.
- Ecological feedback loops monitoredâ€”any imbalance triggers automated purification cycles.
- Blemo refines filter algorithms to prevent over-purification that kills beneficial microbes.
- Exit: Longevity trial phase complete; recommendations sent for global rollout.
