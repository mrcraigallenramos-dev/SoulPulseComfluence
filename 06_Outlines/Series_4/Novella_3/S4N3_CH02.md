Logline: Vaelâ€™s taskforce drafts operational protocols to deploy relic-based advancementsâ€”balancing innovation with fail-safe measures.

Beats:
- HQ brims with holo-maps marking Stabilizer Node network and frontier expansion zones.
- Vael assigns teams: infrastructure, healthcare, security, ecological restorationâ€”each using relics within strict guidelines.
- Simulation drills expose potential failure points: resonance overload, empathic backlash, purity filter collapse.
- Plans include rapid-response contingencies and decentralized node management to prevent single-point failures.
- Debate over civilian vs. military control; consensus: civilian governance with taskforce oversight.
- Exit: Protocols finalized; first deployment wave scheduled to pioneer Floating Cities.
