Logline: Blemo discovers latent safety features in relic tech that can be activated to prevent misuse without damaging functionality.

Beats:
- Lab tests reveal embedded fail-safes triggered by specific purity-frequency signatures.
- Blemo designs purity pulse emitter that toggles safety modes remotely.
- Field prototypes deployed in frontier relic caches.
- Exit: Safety nets prevent next ambush but inspire questions on built-in control by unknown engineers.
