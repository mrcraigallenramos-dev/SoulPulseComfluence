Logline: A relic reactor overload threatens frontier city; Kira deploys empathic resonance to evacuate civilians and calm panicked operators.

Beats:
- Reactor hum escalates; fear amplifies resonance instability.
- Kiraâ€™s field calms operators enough to initiate shutdown sequence.
- Controlled pulse release averts meltdown.
- Exit: City evacuated, gratitude tempered by underlying terror of relic power.
