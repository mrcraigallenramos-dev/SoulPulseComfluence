Logline: Vael maps newly reopened frontier territories, encountering emerging societies adapting relic tech independently of central governance.

Beats:
- Survey drones record independent communities using relic fragments for irrigation, energy, and trade.
- Vaelâ€™s team documents divergent tech uses: hybrid Form-Wholeness farms, empathy-based dispute resolution, purity-driven health clinics.
- Some settlements show early signs of relapse into chaos: misaligned devices causing unstable resonance pockets.
- Vael negotiates tech-sharing pacts while warning of central oversight requirements.
- A rogue enclave repels survey with improvised pulse cannonsâ€”first direct frontier conflict.
- Exit: Vael calls for mobile governance units to integrate frontier innovations under charter safeguards.
