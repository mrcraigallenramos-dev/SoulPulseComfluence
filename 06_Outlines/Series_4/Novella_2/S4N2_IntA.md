Logline: The Auditor assesses frontier data, balancing experimental variables of independent relic use against central governance stability.

Beats:
- Data streams show 14 independent settlements achieving 72% self-sufficiency with relic tech.
- Chaos metrics moderate: isolated conflicts containable with mobile response teams.
- Probability matrices adjusted: allow experimental autonomy thresholds up to 65% before intervention.
- Exit: Frontier phase variables locked for ongoing observation.
