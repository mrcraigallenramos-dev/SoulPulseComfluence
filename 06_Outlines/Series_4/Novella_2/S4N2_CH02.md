Logline: Jhace provides emergency care along volatile trade routes where frontier conflicts erupt over relic resource control.

Beats:
- Convoy ambushed by mercenaries wielding improvised pulse rifles; hybrid healing needed under fire.
- Makeshift field hospital erected; Form splints patch bone, Wholeness mends psychic trauma.
- Civilians caught in crossfire plead for protection rather than charity.
- Jhace negotiates temporary ceasefire using empathic projection to build trust.
- Exit: Passage cleared but frontier instability remains critical threat.
