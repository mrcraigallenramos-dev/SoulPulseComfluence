Logline: Vael leads charter enforcement in frontier regions, facing ideological resistance from locals wary of external authority.

Beats:
- Convoy meets barricades of relic-wielding locals protesting oversight.
- Negotiations reveal fears of repeating past corruption.
- Vael uses data to prove charter safeguards and local board representation.
- Exit: Charter accepted in principle, implementation committees formed.
