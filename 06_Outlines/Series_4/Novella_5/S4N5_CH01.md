Logline: At the Celestial Gate, participants choose permanent cosmic ascension or return to mortal life, facing the consequences of unlimited transcendence.

Beats:
- Massive crystalline arch stands above stratosphere; candidates file through resonance scanners.
- Jhace addresses crowd: choice is irreversibleâ€”ascend to cosmic plane or reclaim humanity fully.
- First ascenders vanish in light; returnees weep relief and mourning.
- Midline rupture: glitch in stabilizer pulses threatens collapse of gate structure.
- Jhace channels hybrid Form/Wholeness to stabilize gate temporarily.
- Exit: Gate secured; final choice countdown resumes under tense calm.
