Logline: Xilcore orchestrates blueprinting of new cosmic nodes to expand post-ascension infrastructure, balancing mathematical order with organic adaptation.

Beats:
- Nodes designed in fractal geometry to support both mortal and ascendant realms.
- Integration teams map resonance flows between Gate and cosmic network.
- Minor lattice failures corrected in real-time.
- Exit: Blueprint rollout begins under hybrid coordination.
