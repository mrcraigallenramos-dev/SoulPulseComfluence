Logline: Vael surveys ruined cities reborn through relic tech, marveling at living architecture yet wary of hidden decay beneath gilded facades.

Beats:
- Streets meld living Form structures and greenery sprouting from purity-enriched soils.
- Vaelâ€™s drone map reveals pockets of cultural revivalâ€”mosaics, murals infused with empathic resonance.
- Underneath: hidden structural rot from incomplete decontamination causing slow collapse zones.
- Vael dispatches repair teams with hybrid maintenance protocols.
- Citizens celebrate new districts while survivors recall past horrors.
- Exit: Urban renaissance but vigilance remains essential to prevent silent decay.
