Logline: Kira curates an empathic art festival, where creators use purified relic pulses to craft living sculptures that reflect communal memory.

Beats:

- Artists integrate Form templates with emotional data for interactive experiences.
- Festival draws visitors worldwide; economic boon and moral reflection.
- Exit: Festival ends; cultural renaissance solidifies identity revival.
