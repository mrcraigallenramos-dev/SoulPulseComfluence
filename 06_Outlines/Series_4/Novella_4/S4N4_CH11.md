Logline: Global council debates heritage of cosmic progenitors, deciding whether to honor their legacy or forge new path.

Beats:
- Delegates present archival findings; some call for cultural revival, others insist on innovation unbound by past.
- Vael proposes future-forward charter integrating heritage respect with creative autonomy.
- Exit: Resolution adopted; cosmic heritage museums established.
