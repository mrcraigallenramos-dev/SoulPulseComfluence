Logline: Jhace oversees reclamation of toxic zones using hybrid Form-Wholeness constructs to create living spires that cleanse and beautify the wastelands.

Beats:
- Team erects seed-infused lattices that grow into living towers, filtering toxins through Wholeness root networks.
- Form beams shape air flow, distributing purified oxygen.
- Local wildlife returns; psych tests show improved mental health.
- Exit: Spire network set for continental rollout.
