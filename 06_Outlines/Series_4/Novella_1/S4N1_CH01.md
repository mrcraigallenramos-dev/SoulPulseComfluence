Logline: Years after transcendence, Jhace leads reconstruction of a shattered metropolis, confronting emergent factions exploiting leftover cosmic technology.

Beats:
- Steel skeletons of former resonance towers dot horizon; survivors clear debris under hybrid conduit scaffolds.
- Jhace uses Form resonance to stabilize structures and Wholeness to calm traumatized citizens.
- Reports of rogue warlords wielding abandoned cosmic devices spark concern.
- First confrontation: mercenary gang fires residual pulse cannons; Jhaceâ€™s hybrid blast disables them with minimal casualties.
- Local council debates ethical use of cosmic tech versus destructionâ€”choice echoes past manipulation debates.
- Ghastly discovery: a cache of frozen conscripts from previous experiments, their bodies twisted by leftover transcendence protocols.
- Exit: Jhace vows to secure technology before new powers arise; volunteers to lead expedition into forbidden zones.
