Logline: Blemo tests Purity techniques on cosmic tech residues, discovering subtle corruption risks and ethical dilemmas of selective deactivation.

Beats:
- Lab subjects exposed to purified tech residues show neural clarity but loss of creative spark.
- Blemo debates whether to decommission nodes or transfer purity protocols to civilian workers.
- Trial of hybrid cleansing shows promise: partial deactivation preserving function while preventing rogue surges.
- Ethical committee convenes over potential cognitive side effects on tech operators.
- Exit: Blemo prepares second-phase trials to refine selective decontamination.
