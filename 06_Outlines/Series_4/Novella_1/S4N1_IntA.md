Logline: The Auditor evaluates post-transcendence instability as cosmic tech misuse cases emerge, adjusting manipulation protocols for stability.

Beats:
- Monitoring node logs show fragmentary rebellion eventsâ€”tech fragments repurposed for violence.
- Chaos indices spike in rebuilt zones; probability modifiers recalibrated.
- Subject Jhaceâ€™s stabilizing actions noted as key variable for community resilience.
- Exit: Recommend controlled release of cosmic tech under regulated authorities only.
