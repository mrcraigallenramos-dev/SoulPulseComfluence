Logline: Jhace leads team into cursed ruins to retrieve powerful relics before insurgents or rogue factions can exploit them.

Beats:
- Team navigates collapsing corridors once stabilized by cosmic techâ€”resonance leaks cause geometric anomalies.
- Guardians of ancient wards test their skills: Form blades slicing chaos, empathy shields against psychic feedback.
- Relics recovered under duress; team evacuates as structure collapses in fractal pattern.
- Exit: Relics secured; reconstruction authority gains leverage over rogue elements.
