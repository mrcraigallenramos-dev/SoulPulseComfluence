Logline: The Auditor reviews security protocols post-insurgency, adjusting manipulation tolerance for sustainable reconstruction.

Beats:
- Audit logs flag insurgent attacks as expected noise; adjust intervention thresholds.
- Recommend increased resilience drills rather than preemptive suppression.
- Reprisals curtailed to maintain community trust metrics.
- Exit: Security phase revision complete.
