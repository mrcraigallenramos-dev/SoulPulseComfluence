Logline: Vael proposes governance reform integrating divine, human, and cosmic oversight bodies to prevent future misuse of relic technology.

Beats:
- Draft charter blends Consortium, Harmony, Purity, Decay, and civilian councils.
- Heated debate over veto powers and intervention triggers.
- Coalition reaches compromise: layered oversight with rapid-response teams.
- Exit: Charter ratified; new governance structure established.
