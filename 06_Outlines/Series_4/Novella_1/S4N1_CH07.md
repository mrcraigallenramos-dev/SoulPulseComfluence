Logline: A radical insurgency forms to reject all cosmic tech, believing any revival mistakes past hubrisâ€”a challenge to reconstruction authority.

Beats:
- Insurgent manifesto demands total eradication of transcendence tech, citing moral failure.
- Vael negotiates but radicals bomb a Form lab, reigniting fears.
- Coalition of moderate leaders unites with reconstruction forces to protect infrastructure.
- Exit: Agreement to secure relics under neutral oversight authority.
