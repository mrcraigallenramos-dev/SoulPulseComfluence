Logline: Kira organizes an empathic resonance field to heal community trauma, but opposition militants seek to hijack it for mind control.

Beats:
- Resonance field generators fashioned from reclaimed cosmic nodes pulse gentle empathy waves through crowd.
- Citizens meditate in unity; scars of past collapses fade under shared compassion.
- Militant sabotage team attempts to tune frequencies for mass suggestibility.
- Kira detects subtle intent shift; recalibrates field to disable sabotage device.
- Field disrupts militant cohesion, forcing them to flee rather than exploit.
- Exit: Community bonds strengthen; Kira resolves to defend resonance tech from exploitation.
