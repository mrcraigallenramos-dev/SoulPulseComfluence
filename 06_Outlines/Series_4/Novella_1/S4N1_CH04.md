Logline: Xilcoreâ€™s Form Consortium holds council to debate civilian oversight of cosmic relics versus strict confiscation, revealing faction fractures.

Beats:
- Delegates argument: regulated access for reconstruction vs. total eradication to prevent weaponization.
- Data projections show unregulated reuse leads to 30% higher collapse risk; eradication risks knowledge loss.
- Xilcore proposes hybrid solution: supervised labs with Form guardianship and civilian oversight boards.
- Hardliners balk, leading to staged demonstration of controlled reconstruction facility.
- Exit: Consortium votes fragile compromiseâ€”supervision rather than blanket ban.
