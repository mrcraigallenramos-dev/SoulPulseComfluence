Logline: Blemo locks down research facilities to analyze revelation truth while questioning whether his pursuit of purity served cosmic manipulation agenda.

Beats:
- Research facility isolation protocols as staff experience identity crisis: questioning whether their scientific work served knowledge or cosmic manipulation.
- Blemo's analysis of revelation evidence confirms systematic orchestration: probability manipulation, timeline guidance, outcome predetermination beyond divine awareness.
- Divine purity nature demands accepting truth regardless of psychological cost: cosmic manipulation validated through rigorous analysis and verification.
- Research into Counter-Spark operations reveals sophisticated psychological warfare: civilization-scale experimentation using entire populations as test subjects.
- Recognition that divine purity pursuit served manipulation by eliminating creative chaos necessary for genuine autonomous development.
- Clinical analysis of revelation trauma shows unprecedented psychological damage: betrayal exposure creating identity dissolution beyond traditional therapeutic intervention.
- Research protocols for treating cosmic-scale psychological warfare: therapeutic techniques for recovering authentic identity after systematic manipulation exposure.
- Divine consultation with siblings reveals universal research: each god analyzing manipulation scope while questioning authenticity of their own existence.
- Exit: Blemo's research confirms worst fears while providing no solutions for healing damage caused by truth revelation.
