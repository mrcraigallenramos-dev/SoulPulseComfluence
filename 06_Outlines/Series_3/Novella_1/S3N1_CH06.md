Logline: Kira struggles to maintain commune stability while experiencing continental-scale empathic overload from mass psychological crisis.

Beats:
- Reformed commune systems collapse as citizens lose faith in authentic choice: shared decision-making impossible when no decisions feel genuine.
- Kira's empathic abilities overwhelmed by continental psychological crisis: millions experiencing identity breakdown through revelation trauma exposure.
- Empathic network effects amplify individual trauma into collective despair: shared emotional processing creating psychological feedback loops.
- Citizens request empathic suppression rather than connection: preferring isolation to contamination from others' existential crisis and betrayal trauma.
- Kira attempts empathic shielding techniques but faces her own manipulation questions: abilities enhanced through orchestrated experiences for cosmic agenda service.
- Communication with other empaths reveals universal overload: empathic networks becoming conduits for psychological warfare rather than healing support.
- Strategic retreat from empathic connection to prevent further damage, leaving citizens isolated during crisis requiring maximum support.
- Personal identity crisis as Kira questions authenticity of her caring nature: genuine compassion or programmed empathic response serving manipulation agenda?
- Exit: Commune dissolution as citizens unable to trust shared emotion or cooperative decision-making under cosmic manipulation shadow.
