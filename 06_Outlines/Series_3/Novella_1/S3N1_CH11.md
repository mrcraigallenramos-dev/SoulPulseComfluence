Logline: Tiffani observes reconstruction efforts with satisfaction while preparing next manipulation phase designed to test population resilience and authentic choice capacity.

Beats:
- Dimensional observation reveals population adaptation to revelation trauma: some citizens developing authentic resilience while others remain psychologically devastated.
- Statistical analysis shows optimal breakdown distribution: enough trauma to shatter artificial systems while preserving population capacity for controlled reconstruction.
- Tiffani experiences internal conflict between Auditor objectives and residual authentic affection for Jhace and reformed society achievements.
- Counter-Spark conditioning suppresses emotional responses while maintaining personality interface necessary for continued manipulation effectiveness.
- Strategic planning for phase transition: introducing controlled hope and recovery opportunities to test population genuine choice capacity versus continued manipulation vulnerability.
- Coordination with cosmic manipulation systems to adjust probability flows supporting authentic development while maintaining experimental control.
- Personal reflection on identity merger: Tiffani memories providing emotional insight while Auditor consciousness maintains cosmic perspective and manipulation objectives.
- Preparation for next revelation phase: deeper truth exposure about universal foundations and cosmic manipulation scope to test ultimate resilience limits.
- Exit: Phase transition begins as Tiffani allows limited recovery while preparing for ultimate truth revelation about cosmic reality foundations.
