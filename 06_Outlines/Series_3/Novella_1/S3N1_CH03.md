- Emergency communication networks overwhelmed with reports: reality distortions, empathic psychological contagion, mass identity crisis across reformed territories.
- Vael recognizes pattern from historical research: revelation scenarios designed to shatter social cohesion through systematic betrayal exposure.
- Network coordination complicated by trust breakdown: agents questioning whether their own recruitment and loyalty were manipulated by cosmic forces.
- Intelligence analysis reveals Tiffani's survival was known to Counter-Spark agents throughout timeline: network infiltration deeper than previously discovered.
- Strategic assessment shows reformed society's strength becoming weakness: empathic networks and cooperative systems amplifying psychological devastation.
- Vael confronts her own manipulation history: investigation into Tiffani guided to discover evidence at optimal timing for maximum impact.
- Communication with divine advisors reveals gods' shock and uncertainty: their transformation questioned as potentially orchestrated manipulation.
- Crisis response protocols strain under unprecedented scope: individual therapy insufficient for continental-scale psychological warfare.
- Exit: Vael realizes network defensive preparation served manipulation agenda by concentrating population for maximum impact during revelation.
