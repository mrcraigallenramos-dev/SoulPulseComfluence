Logline: Vael attempts network reconstruction using verification protocols to distinguish authentic relationships from manipulated connections.

Beats:
- Network reconstruction requires trust verification: developing methods to distinguish genuine loyalty from cosmic manipulation and systematic programming.
- Intelligence analysis reveals manipulation depth: Counter-Spark influence extending through historical timeline affecting multiple civilization cycles.
- Vael's leadership challenged by agents questioning whether their recruitment and service served authentic resistance or cosmic manipulation agenda.
- Development of authenticity protocols: behavioral analysis, memory verification, choice reconstruction to identify genuine versus programmed responses.
- Strategic planning for post-revelation society: building cooperation systems resistant to cosmic manipulation while preserving benefits of reformed governance.
- Communication with remaining loyal agents requires verification procedures: ensuring authentic connection while acknowledging possible continued manipulation.
- Investigation into historical patterns reveals consistent methodology: revelation trauma followed by reconstruction phase testing population resilience and adaptation.
- Recognition that reconstruction efforts may serve manipulation agenda: allowed recovery creating false security before deeper revelation phases.
- Exit: Network partially rebuilt with enhanced authenticity verification while acknowledging continued vulnerability to cosmic manipulation.
