Logline: Leesa experiences continental-scale emotional devastation as her divine empathy connects her to millions experiencing ultimate betrayal trauma.

Beats:
- Empathic monitoring systems overload as population experiences mass psychological crisis: divine consciousness contaminated by continental-scale despair.
- Leesa forced to experience every citizen's betrayal trauma simultaneously: her divine nature demanding she feel all pain while lacking power to heal.
- Recognition that her empathic nature served manipulation agenda: forced connection to citizen suffering providing Counter-Spark with emotional leverage.
- Divine attempts to provide comfort fail as citizens reject empathic connection: preferring isolation to shared emotion under manipulation shadow.
- Internal divine crisis as Leesa questions authenticity of her compassionate nature: genuine divinity or cosmic programming serving Counter-Spark objectives?
- Sibling consultation reveals universal divine despair: each god questioning reality of their existence and service while mortals experience psychological collapse.
- Strategic withdrawal from empathic monitoring to prevent further contamination: divine isolation during crisis requiring maximum support and guidance.
- Recognition that divine cooperation and advisory relationships amplified betrayal impact by creating trust that revelation systematically destroyed.
- Exit: Leesa's empathic withdrawal leaving millions without divine support during greatest psychological crisis in civilizational history.
