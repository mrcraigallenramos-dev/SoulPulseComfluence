Logline: Tiffani observes Jhace's breakdown with clinical satisfaction while managing revelation timing for maximum psychological impact across reformed society.

Beats:
- Dimensional observation platform allows monitoring of multiple probability streams: Jhace's breakdown, Kira's isolation, citizen psychological contagion spreading perfectly.
- Statistical analysis confirms optimal trauma distribution: revelation shock propagating through empathic networks to affect maximum population with precise emotional devastation.
- Memory review of manipulation timeline: initial meeting, relationship development, betrayal staging, death simulationâ€”all choreographed for this moment.
- Tiffani experiences brief emotional echo of genuine affection for Jhace but suppresses it as Counter-Spark conditioning maintains cosmic perspective.
- Manipulation protocol adjustment: allow Jhace sufficient recovery time to process betrayal while preventing psychological complete breakdown that would eliminate utility.
- Strategic coordination with divine advisors: gods unaware of cosmic manipulation scale, their cooperation serving Counter-Spark agenda without their knowledge.
- Personal reflection on identity merger: Tiffani personality preserved as useful interface while Auditor consciousness maintains absolute control and cosmic perspective.
- Exit: Revelation phase two preparationâ€”systematic exposure of manipulation scope to shatter all remaining trust in authentic choice and cooperation.
