Logline: The Auditor initiates revelation phase as subjects discover cosmic manipulation evidence according to calculated timeline parameters.

Beats:
- Statistical analysis confirms optimal revelation timing - subjects demonstrating required psychological investment in reformed systems for maximum impact.
- Discovery protocols proceed within acceptable parameters - manipulation evidence exposure following predetermined revelation cascades.
- Subject psychological profiles show enhanced vulnerability to systematic betrayal due to integration success and cooperative achievement investment.
- Probability manipulation systems adjusted to support discovery timeline while maintaining experimental control over revelation scope and impact.
- Revelation phase serves experimental objectives by testing subject capacity for authentic choice discovery under systematic manipulation awareness.
- Manipulation framework evolution continues through controlled revelation providing enhanced testing opportunities for authentic choice resilience.
- Exit: Revelation cascade initiated with optimal psychological impact parameters for continued experimental manipulation and subject testing.
