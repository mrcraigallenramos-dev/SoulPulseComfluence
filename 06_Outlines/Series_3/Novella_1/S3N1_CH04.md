Logline: Xilcore's divine certainty crumbles as Tiffani reveals cosmic manipulation extending beyond mortal affairs to include divine awakening and cooperation.

Beats:
- Divine council emergency session as reality distortions threaten geometric foundations of reformed faction territories and cooperative governance.
- Tiffani's dimensional intrusion into divine space demonstrates authority transcending god-tier abilities: Counter-Spark manipulation operating at cosmic scale.
- She presents evidence of divine manipulation: awakening timing, sibling cooperation, reformed advisory relationshipsâ€”all serving Counter-Spark experimental agenda.
- Xilcore's geometric consciousness experiences unprecedented uncertainty: mathematical certainties revealing themselves as imposed rather than discovered universal laws.
- Divine consultation reveals universal crisis: each god questioning authenticity of their nature, development, and decision-making throughout awakening period.
- Analysis of cosmic balance readings shows systematic manipulation of universal forces: apparent natural evolution artificially guided by Counter-Spark influence.
- Recognition that divine cooperation success served manipulation by creating trust relationships that amplify betrayal psychological impact.
- Strategic assessment reveals divine vulnerability: absolute natures compromised by revelation that their existence may serve enemy agenda.
- Exit: Divine council paralyzed by cosmic-scale identity crisis while mortal territories experience social collapse from revelation trauma.
