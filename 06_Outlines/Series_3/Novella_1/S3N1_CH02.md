Logline: Kira's empathic abilities detect Tiffani's return through Jhace's emotional collapse, experiencing secondhand the devastation of ultimate betrayal.

Beats:
- Commune morning shattered by empathic shock wave: Jhace's emotional devastation propagating through Kira's enhanced abilities to nearby citizens.
- Kira recognizes the signatureâ€”Tiffani's resonance unchanged by death, integrated with cosmic manipulation frequencies beyond mortal comprehension.
- Empathic projection into Jhace's experience reveals systematic betrayal: every moment of love, partnership, and growth serving unknown agenda.
- Citizens affected by emotional feedback begin questioning their own relationships and choicesâ€”mass psychological contagion spreading through empathic networks.
- Kira attempts damage control through empathic stabilization but faces her own crisis: their partnership also orchestrated, her abilities enhanced for manipulation service.
- Reformed commune systems strain under psychological pressure as citizens experience identity crisis through shared empathic connection.
- Desperate attempt to reach Jhace through empathic link reveals Tiffani blocking communication with cosmic-level interference patterns.
- Exit: Kira isolated from her partner while commune citizens spiral into existential despair through empathic contamination from ultimate betrayal.
