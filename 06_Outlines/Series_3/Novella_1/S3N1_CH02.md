Logline: Kira's empathic abilities detect cosmic manipulation patterns while she processes her own grief over Tiffani's loss and questions about authentic emotion.

Beats:
- Empathic monitoring reveals systematic emotional manipulation spanning integration period - suggesting guided rather than authentic choice development.
- Citizens demonstrate identical emotional responses to integration stress - patterns indicating programmed rather than genuine psychological adaptation.
- Kira experiences empathic interference suggesting external manipulation of her own abilities during awakening and integration periods.
- Memory analysis reveals empathic enhancement timing that suggests orchestrated rather than natural ability development through cosmic events.
- Grief over Tiffani compounds as she realizes her empathic growth may have been artificially guided rather than authentic personal development.
- Community emotional patterns show mathematical precision in response distribution - indicating systematic manipulation rather than natural social evolution.
- Empathic network effects reveal continental-scale emotional manipulation through coordinated influence rather than authentic collective development.
- Exit: Discovery of empathic manipulation evidence while mourning Tiffani creates identity crisis about authentic versus programmed emotional capacity.
