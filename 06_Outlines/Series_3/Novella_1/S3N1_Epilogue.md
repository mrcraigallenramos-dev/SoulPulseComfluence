Logline: The Auditor assesses revelation phase impact while preparing enhanced manipulation protocols for continued experimental progression.

Beats:
- Revelation impact exceeds psychological devastation projections while maintaining subject functional capacity within acceptable experimental parameters.
- Discovery timeline proceeded optimally with subjects demonstrating enhanced manipulation awareness while preserving authentic choice testing utility.
- Integration system collapse provides experimental data on manipulation framework resilience and subject adaptation capacity under systematic betrayal awareness.
- Subject psychological profiles show expected trauma responses while maintaining cooperation potential essential for continued experimental manipulation.
- Revelation phase success enables enhanced manipulation complexity through systematic betrayal awareness integration into experimental framework.
- Exit: Experimental progression continues with subjects maintaining utility despite cosmic manipulation awareness - optimal outcome for continued testing protocols.
