Logline: Reality fractures as Tiffani materializes in Jhace's medical centerâ€”alive, unchanged, and claiming to be the Auditor who orchestrated everything from the beginning.

Beats:
- Morning routine shattered as dimensional rifts tear through medical center walls; patients scream as geometry becomes negotiable.
- Tiffani steps through impossible space, wearing expression of cosmic authority mixed with familiar warmthâ€”three years of grief collapse into cognitive dissonance.
- She explains with patient condescension: "I am the Auditor. I orchestrated your awakening, the faction wars, integration, liberationâ€”every choice was choreographed."
- Jhace's hybrid abilities detect truth in her resonance while his mind rejects the systematic betrayal of everything meaningful in his existence.
- Medical emergency as reality distortions affect patientsâ€”Jhace forced to provide care while processing revelation that his healer's calling may be manipulation.
- Tiffani demonstrates cosmic awareness: predicting staff reactions, patient needs, his own emotional responses with inhuman precision.
- She offers proof through shared memories: moments he thought private were observed, analyzed, recorded for cosmic manipulation database.
- Exit: Jhace's desperate attempt to deny the evidence while patients suffer from reality instability caused by his emotional breakdown.
