Logline: Jhace discovers reality distortions suggesting cosmic-scale manipulation, but without Tiffani to help process the implications, he faces the truth alone while still grieving her loss.

Beats:
- Medical center instruments detect probability fluctuations and reality distortions that suggest systematic cosmic manipulation beyond divine faction activities.
- Jhace's hybrid abilities reveal manipulation signatures in fundamental forces - patterns indicating orchestrated rather than natural cosmic development.
- Analysis of faction integration success shows mathematical precision suggesting guidance rather than authentic social evolution.
- Memory examination reveals gaps and inconsistencies in his own timeline that suggest external manipulation of personal development and choices.
- Grief over Tiffani's absence intensifies as he realizes how much he needs her empathic insights to process cosmic-scale betrayal implications.
- Investigation into manipulation scope reveals evidence spanning entire awakening timeline - suggesting orchestrated rather than natural divine emergence.
- Patient care becomes complicated by questions of authentic choice - whether his healing serves genuine welfare or unknown manipulation objectives.
- Exit: Discovery of systematic manipulation evidence while mourning Tiffani's death creates psychological crisis requiring processing cosmic betrayal alone.
