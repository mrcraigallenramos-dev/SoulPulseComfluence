Logline: Isolated by revelation trauma, Jhace attempts to process systematic betrayal while his hybrid abilities destabilize from emotional devastation.

Beats:
- Medical facility abandoned as staff experience existential crisis: if Jhace's calling was manipulated, what purpose remains in healing service?
- Jhace reviews every memory of Tiffani through manipulation lens: genuine moments becoming suspect, authentic emotion questioned as programmed response.
- Hybrid abilities fluctuate dangerously as emotional foundation collapses: Form techniques becoming chaotic, Wholeness abilities causing empathic damage.
- Attempted healing of trauma patients results in accidental harm: his emotional instability contaminating therapeutic resonance with despair and betrayal.
- Self-examination reveals identity crisis: if awakening was orchestrated, are his abilities authentic or artificial constructs serving cosmic manipulation?
- Communication attempts with Kira blocked by Tiffani's interference: empathic isolation amplifying psychological devastation through enforced solitude.
- Memory palace technique reveals hidden gaps: moments of lost time suggesting deeper manipulation than conscious relationship betrayal.
- Confrontation with medical oath and professional ethics: continuing service despite cosmic manipulation or abandoning calling due to orchestrated origins.
- Exit: Jhace's breakdown threatens patients as unstable abilities create medical emergencies requiring intervention he cannot safely provide.
