Logline: Jhace guides the first wave of post-threshold reality integration, helping individuals anchor their authentic choice within the new universal framework.

Beats:
- Integration centers open worldwide: participants report conscious expansion with preserved self-awareness.
- Hybrid resonance techniques adapted for ongoing supportâ€”blending Form structure, empathy, truth clarity, and natural change.
- Ethical frameworks shift to universal stewardshipâ€”governance advisory roles replaced by collaborative cosmic-human councils.
- Case studies: individuals facing challenges balancing new cosmic senses with daily lifeâ€”anxiety, awe, purpose realignment.
- Exit: Jhace establishes Academy of Authentic Choice to train future guardians of post-threshold evolution.
