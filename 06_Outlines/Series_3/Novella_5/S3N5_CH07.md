Logline: Seeri completes the Convergence by weaving entropy into the cosmic weave, allowing natural change to cement the transcendence transformation.

Beats:
- Entropic pulses dissolve residual bindingsâ€”participantsâ€™ identities fluidly adapt to new cosmic structures.
- Patterns of decay and renewal integrated into Form-empathy-truth matrix, balancing creation and dissolution.
- Seeri monitors fractal collapse and re-formation events across global resonance nodes.
- Exit: Entropic phase ends; cosmic weave stabilizedâ€”universal transcendence achieved.
