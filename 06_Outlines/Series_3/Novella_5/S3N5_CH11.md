Logline: Vael chairs the first Democratic Evolution Forum, blending individual choice with cosmic wisdom for governance in post-threshold society.

- Ethical debates on universal rights versus individual liberties in new reality framework.
- Exit: Charter of Authentic Choice ratified as foundational law of post-threshold society.
