Logline: Citizens prepare for the next evolutionary transcendence, facing the choice to expand beyond the individual self into universal consciousness.

Beats:
- Jhace guides patients through advanced conditioning protocols to test capacity for consciousness expansion without losing autonomous identity.
- Medical systems recalibrated to support pre-transcendence diagnostics: psychological resilience, neural flexibility, emotional anchoring.
- Patients range from eager pioneers to fearful holdouts, each requiring tailored programs that respect real choice.
- Hybrid resonance techniques adapted for final preparation: precise calibrations of Form structure and Wholeness empathy for safe threshold crossing.
- Ethical debates flare: is fully leaving the individual self irreversible liberation or cosmic suicide?
- Jhaceâ€™s own doubts surface as he balances professional duty with existential questions about what transcendence entails.
- Initial threshold tests yield mixed resultsâ€”some experience profound clarity, others report disorienting fracturing.
- JR3: Probability modulation protocols adjust to maintain acceptable success rates while preserving genuine consent.
- Exit: Final pre-transcendence briefing calls all participants to the Convergence Point for the ultimate collective decision.
