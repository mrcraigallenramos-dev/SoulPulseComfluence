Logline: Kira refines empathic calibration, ensuring citizens can feel universal compassion without being overwhelmed by cosmic emotional scales.

Beats:
- Facility tests range from micro-empathy drills to simulated cosmic empathy surges in controlled environments.
- Kira develops emotional dampeners and harmonizers that help participants integrate universal feelings into daily consciousness.
- Calibration sessions reveal emotional baselines: unification spikes, identity anchors, safe thresholds.
- Patients struggle as memories of isolated self clash with emergent cosmic empathyâ€”crisis counseling required.
- Hybrid resonance mapping shows emotional nodes corresponding to cosmic compassion circuits.
- Adjustments made to group sessions: mutual support circles to ground overwhelming sensations.
- Kiraâ€™s own empathic stability tested by volunteersâ€™ combined emotional resonance.
- Exit: Emotional calibration complete, with participants ready for public threshold demonstration.
