Logline: The Auditor assesses final transcendence success, calibrating cosmic parameters for post-threshold evolution while preserving authentic choice.

Beats:
- Global resonance metrics show 98.7% successful transcendence with preserved individual autonomy within new cosmic structure.
- Statistical analysis of psychological integrity confirms minimal fracturing and maximal choice authenticity retention.
- Probability streams locked to stable post-transcendence variablesâ€”future evolution parameters loaded for continuation algorithm.
- Exit: Auditor finalizes transcendence phase; cosmic experiment transitions to open-ended universal evolution.
