Logline: Vael oversees global network activation, coordinating support nodes and emergency response as the Convergence Point draws near.

Beats:
- Command vault hums with encrypted channels linking all preparation centersâ€”logistics, medical, empathic, ethical oversight.
- Real-time data feeds track participant vitals, emotional baselines, resonance stability, and consent confirmations.
- Emergency protocols stand by: reintegration teams, recovery units, psychological first-aid squads.
- Vael reviews potential failure scenariosâ€”partial transcendence, identity fracturing, group panicâ€”and readies containment strategies.
- Team debates last-minute adjustments: universal soak-phase rather than immediate full crossing.
- Exit: Global countdown begins, final phase initiated on Auditorâ€™s go-code.
