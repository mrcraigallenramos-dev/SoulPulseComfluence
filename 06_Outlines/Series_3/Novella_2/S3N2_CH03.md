Logline: Vael analyzes reconstruction patterns across continental territories, discovering Counter-Spark manipulation continues through controlled recovery and guided authenticity development.

Beats:
- Intelligence analysis reveals reconstruction success distribution: certain areas achieving faster recovery suggesting continued guided development rather than authentic adaptation.
- Network monitoring detects subtle manipulation patterns: probability adjustments supporting specific reconstruction outcomes while appearing natural.
- Vael realizes authenticity verification systems may serve manipulation agenda: creating false security while Counter-Spark influence continues through verification process itself.
- Cross-referencing historical data shows consistent pattern: revelation trauma followed by guided recovery serving experimental objectives.
- Investigation into current operations reveals Counter-Spark agents still active: individuals positioned to influence reconstruction while maintaining cover.
- Strategic assessment shows network vulnerability: trust rebuilding creating new manipulation opportunities through selective information and guided decision-making.
- Communication with regional coordinators confirms universal pattern: reconstruction proceeding too smoothly suggesting orchestrated rather than authentic development.
- Vael confronts possibility that her own leadership and investigation serve manipulation agenda: allowed discovery creating false resistance narrative.
- Exit: Discovery of active Counter-Spark facility conducting real-time reconstruction monitoring and adjustment protocols.
