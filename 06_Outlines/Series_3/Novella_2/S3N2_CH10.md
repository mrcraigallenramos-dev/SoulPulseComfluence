Logline: Kira develops advanced empathic techniques for detecting authentic emotion versus Counter-Spark emotional programming in complex identity cases.

Beats:
- Laboratory development of empathic archaeology: techniques for discovering authentic emotional core beneath Counter-Spark emotional programming.
- Kira's abilities evolve through conscious development: empathic capacity growing beyond Counter-Spark enhancement through authentic choice and practice.
- Emotional verification reveals spectrum of authenticity: genuine feelings preserved within artificial emotional constructs serving manipulation objectives.
- Treatment of complex cases shows Counter-Spark sophistication: emotional programming using authentic feeling as foundation for guided emotional development.
- Kira experiences personal breakthrough: distinguishing authentic empathic nature from Counter-Spark enhancement while preserving genuine caring capacity.
- Empathic reconstruction demonstrates population resilience: citizens rebuilding authentic emotional capacity despite Counter-Spark emotional programming.
- Laboratory coordination with Jhace reveals hybrid approach effectiveness: combining Form analysis with empathic detection for comprehensive authenticity assessment.
- Research breakthrough reveals Counter-Spark vulnerability: authentic emotion transcending programming when consciously chosen and mutually supported.
- Exit: Empathic detection reveals concerning evidence: some reconstructing citizens may be Counter-Spark agents rather than manipulated authentic individuals.
