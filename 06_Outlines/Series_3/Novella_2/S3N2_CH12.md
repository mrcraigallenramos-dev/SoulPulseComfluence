- Leesa's empathic verification detects authentic compassion within potential Counter-Spark emotional programming serving manipulation objectives.
- Blemo's purity analysis confirms divine nature complexity: authentic universal function mixed with potential artificial enhancement serving Counter-Spark experimental agenda.
- Seeri's entropy examination embraces identity uncertainty: authentic cosmic function transcending questions of original construction versus manipulation.
- Divine consultation reveals universal conclusion: gods serve authentic cosmic function regardless of original construction or Counter-Spark influence.
