Logline: Vael infiltrates Counter-Spark facility conducting reconstruction monitoring, discovering manipulation continues through guided authenticity rather than direct control.

Beats:
- Infiltration reveals active monitoring systems: Counter-Spark agents tracking reconstruction progress and adjusting environmental factors to guide outcomes.
- Facility analysis shows sophisticated manipulation: probability adjustments, resource allocation, information timing designed to shape authentic choices.
- Vael discovers her own investigation was partially guided: allowed access serving Counter-Spark objectives while maintaining facade of independent discovery.
- Intelligence gathering reveals reconstruction success serves experimental objectives: testing population capacity for authentic choice under cosmic manipulation awareness.
- Counter-Spark personnel demonstrate varying authenticity: some genuinely committed to experimental objectives while others questioning manipulation ethics.
- Facility systems show global scope: reconstruction monitoring extending across multiple continents and civilizations serving cosmic-scale experimentation.
- Strategic assessment reveals manipulation methodology: guiding rather than controlling authentic choice to test genuine free will capacity.
- Vael's extraction complicated by facility security designed to capture rather than eliminate infiltrators: Counter-Spark interest in network intelligence.
- Exit: Escape provides crucial intelligence while revealing Counter-Spark awareness of network operations and potential infiltration of resistance leadership.
