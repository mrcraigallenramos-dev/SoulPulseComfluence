Logline: Tiffani coordinates reconstruction guidance while experiencing increasing resistance to Counter-Spark conditioning as authentic emotions strengthen.

Beats:
- Coordination center monitors reconstruction progress: guiding recovery toward optimal psychological resilience testing while maintaining experimental control.
- Statistical analysis shows population adaptation exceeding projections: authentic choice capacity developing faster than Counter-Spark models predicted.
- Tiffani experiences growing internal conflict: Auditor objectives versus authentic concern for Jhace and reconstructing society.
- Memory integration reveals suppressed emotional connections: genuine affection for individuals and communities transcending manipulation programming.
- Counter-Spark conditioning protocols strain under emotional resistance: Tiffani personality asserting authenticity against cosmic manipulation directives.
- Strategic planning requires balancing experimental objectives with increasing personal investment in subject welfare and authentic development.
- Coordination with other Counter-Spark agents reveals universal pattern: extended contact with authentic choice creating resistance to manipulation conditioning.
- Exit: Tiffani begins subtle sabotage of guidance protocols while maintaining facade of Counter-Spark loyalty and experimental objective service.
