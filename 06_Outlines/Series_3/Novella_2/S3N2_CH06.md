Logline: Leesa attempts to rebuild empathic networks damaged by revelation trauma while questioning whether divine empathy serves authentic compassion or cosmic manipulation.

Beats:
- Empathic network reconstruction requires careful emotional archaeology: distinguishing authentic feeling from programmed emotional responses.
- Leesa's divine empathy detects genuine emotional healing: citizens developing authentic feeling capacity despite cosmic manipulation awareness.
- Divine consultation with siblings reveals universal question: whether their emotional nature serves genuine compassion or Counter-Spark emotional manipulation objectives.
- Empathic monitoring shows citizens developing emotional resilience: authentic feeling emerging through conscious choice rather than divine programming.
- Leesa experiences divine identity crisis: questioning whether empathic nature represents authentic compassion or cosmic programming serving manipulation agenda.
- Network coordination demonstrates genuine cooperation: empathic connections transcending orchestrated origins through conscious authenticity verification.
- Divine service continues despite identity uncertainty: providing emotional support regardless of personal authenticity questions.
- Empathic reconstruction reveals concerning pattern: emotional healing proceeding according to Counter-Spark predictive models rather than natural recovery.
- Exit: Divine empathy detects active Counter-Spark emotional manipulation continuing during reconstruction through subtle guidance rather than overt control.
