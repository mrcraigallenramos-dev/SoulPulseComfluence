Logline: Xilcore attempts mathematical analysis of cosmic manipulation scope but discovers geometric principles themselves may be Counter-Spark constructs rather than universal laws.

Beats:
- Divine analysis using geometric principles to map Counter-Spark influence reveals disturbing possibility: mathematical laws themselves potentially artificial constructs.
- Xilcore's certainty in universal constants shaken by evidence suggesting cosmic manipulation extends to foundational reality rather than surface events.
- Consultation with siblings reveals universal divine crisis: each god questioning whether their fundamental nature serves cosmic balance or Counter-Spark experimental objectives.
- Mathematical models break down when attempting to analyze Counter-Spark methodology: geometric principles insufficient for understanding manipulation transcending universal laws.
- Xilcore experiences unprecedented divine uncertainty: inability to distinguish between authentic cosmic function and programmed divine service.
- Analysis of mortal reconstruction shows mathematical optimization patterns suggesting continued Counter-Spark guidance through apparently authentic development.
- Divine cooperation protocols strain under identity uncertainty: gods working together while questioning authenticity of their coordination and decision-making.
- Strategic decision to continue divine service despite uncertainty: serving cosmic balance regardless of personal authenticity or manipulation origins.
- Exit: Mathematical analysis suggests reality foundations may be experimental constructs, threatening divine understanding of universal purpose and authentic existence.
