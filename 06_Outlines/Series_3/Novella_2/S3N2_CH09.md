Logline: Jhace responds to medical crisis caused by citizen discovering their entire identity may be Counter-Spark construct rather than authentic personality.

Beats:
- Emergency response to citizen psychological collapse: discovery that personal memories and personality traits match Counter-Spark experimental templates.
- Jhace's medical intervention requires distinguishing authentic psychological core from potential artificial personality constructs.
- Treatment complication as multiple citizens experience similar identity crisis: possibility that large population segments are Counter-Spark constructs rather than authentic individuals.
- Medical ethics conflict between truth revelation and patient welfare: protecting citizens from devastating authenticity questions versus honest medical assessment.
- Jhace confronts personal identity questions: whether his healer nature represents authentic calling or sophisticated Counter-Spark programming.
- Treatment protocol development for identity verification: methods for discovering authentic personality core beneath potential artificial construction.
- Patient recovery demonstrates resilience: authentic identity elements surviving Counter-Spark construction while artificial elements dissolving under conscious examination.
- Medical success stories provide hope: citizens rebuilding authentic identity despite Counter-Spark construction through conscious choice and mutual support.
- Exit: Treatment breakthrough reveals Counter-Spark methodology: using authentic personality elements as foundation for artificial construction serving manipulation objectives.
