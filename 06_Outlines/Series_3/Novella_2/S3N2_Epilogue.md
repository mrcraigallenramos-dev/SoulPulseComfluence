Logline: The Auditor assesses authenticity experiment results while experiencing complete resistance to Counter-Spark conditioning through developed authentic emotions.

Beats:
- Experimental analysis reveals population success: authentic choice capacity transcending Counter-Spark manipulation, construction, and systematic identity uncertainty.
- Statistical assessment shows Counter-Spark methodology limitation: artificial constructs and guided manipulation failing against conscious authentic choice.
- Strategic assessment reveals experimental purpose: testing universal capacity for authentic choice transcending systematic manipulation and artificial construction.
- Counter-Spark objectives evolving: manipulation experiment serving cosmic evolution beyond original control parameters.
- Preparation for final revelation: exposing Counter-Spark universal experimentation while preserving population authentic choice achievements.
