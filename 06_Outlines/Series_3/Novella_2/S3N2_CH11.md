Logline: Vael implements comprehensive agent verification after discovering Counter-Spark infiltration extends to network leadership through sophisticated identity construction.

Beats:
- Network verification reveals infiltration depth: Counter-Spark agents positioned throughout leadership using constructed identities rather than converted authentic individuals.
- Agent screening using Catalyst verification techniques distinguishes authentic network members from Counter-Spark constructs serving infiltration objectives.
- Vael confronts personal verification: testing her own authenticity against possibility of sophisticated Counter-Spark construction serving manipulation objectives.
- Network reconstruction requires building new trust systems: cooperation based on verified authenticity rather than assumed shared objectives.
- Counter-Spark agent behavior patterns reveal methodology: sophisticated constructs demonstrating apparent authenticity while serving manipulation objectives.
- Strategic planning addresses infiltration vulnerability: developing cooperation systems resistant to Counter-Spark construction while preserving authentic leadership.
- Network coordination demonstrates resilience: authentic members working together despite Counter-Spark infiltration and systematic manipulation.
- Verification breakthrough reveals Counter-Spark limitation: constructs requiring external maintenance while authentic individuals self-sustaining through conscious choice.
- Exit: Network partially reconstructed with verified authentic membership while acknowledging continued Counter-Spark infiltration risk.
