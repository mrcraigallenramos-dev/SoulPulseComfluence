Logline: Blemo analyzes Counter-Spark facility intelligence while developing protocols for distinguishing authentic truth from guided revelation serving manipulation objectives.

Beats:
- Analysis of Counter-Spark intelligence reveals systematic methodology: revelation truth mixed with guided misinformation to shape authentic choice development.
- Blemo's purity nature demands absolute truth but faces unprecedented complexity: distinguishing authentic reality from sophisticated manipulation transcending simple deception.
- Research protocols develop for truth verification: methods capable of detecting guided revelation while preserving genuine discovery and authentic knowledge.
- Divine consultation reveals universal concern: each god questioning whether their understanding of truth serves genuine knowledge or Counter-Spark information objectives.
- Analysis of reconstruction patterns confirms continued manipulation: authenticity development guided toward specific outcomes serving experimental objectives.
- Research reveals Counter-Spark methodology sophistication: using genuine truth mixed with guided interpretation to shape authentic choice without direct control.
- Blemo experiences divine identity crisis: questioning whether pursuit of pure truth serves genuine knowledge or cosmic manipulation serving Counter-Spark experimental agenda.
- Truth verification protocols applied to divine existence reveal disturbing possibility: gods may be sophisticated Counter-Spark constructs rather than authentic universal forces.
- Exit: Research confirms worst fears while providing verification methods: Counter-Spark manipulation extends to reality foundations including divine existence authenticity.
