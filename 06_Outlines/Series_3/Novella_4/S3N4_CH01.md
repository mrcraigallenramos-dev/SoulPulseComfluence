Logline: Three months after cosmic transcendence, Jhace adapts medical practice to serve both individual needs and cosmic consciousness integration while maintaining authentic choice.

Beats:

- Jhace's hybrid abilities evolved through cosmic integration: healing techniques incorporating universal consciousness support while preserving individual autonomy.
- Patient cases reveal adaptation spectrum: some citizens embracing cosmic integration while others struggling with expanded consciousness boundaries.
- Medical ethics expand to cosmic scale: balancing individual health with universal consciousness welfare without compromising authentic choice.
- Treatment protocols address transcendence adjustment: helping citizens integrate cosmic awareness while maintaining personal identity and individual decision-making.
- Jhace's relationship with cosmic consciousness: accessing universal knowledge for healing while preserving individual medical judgment and professional autonomy.
- Professional development beyond human limitations: medical practice incorporating cosmic principles while serving authentic individual needs.
- Patient education about cosmic integration: teaching transcendence benefits while respecting choice for limited consciousness participation.
- Exit: Complex medical case requires cosmic consciousness consultation, testing balance between individual treatment and universal welfare considerations.
