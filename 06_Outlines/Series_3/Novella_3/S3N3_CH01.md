Logline: Jhace leads efforts to develop universal verification systems capable of detecting cosmic-scale manipulation, but discovery threatens to reveal reality itself as experimental construct.

Beats:
- Universal verification center attempts to analyze cosmic foundations: testing whether universal laws represent authentic reality or sophisticated experimental constructs.
- Jhace's hybrid abilities pushed beyond previous limits: resonance detection extended to cosmic scale revealing disturbing patterns in fundamental forces.
- Analysis reveals mathematical impossibilities: universal constants showing artificial precision suggesting designed rather than natural cosmic development.
- Verification techniques detect manipulation signatures in quantum foundations: reality itself potentially serving as sophisticated Counter-Spark experimental framework.
- Jhace confronts ultimate identity crisis: if reality is experimental construct, authentic choice may be impossible despite conscious intention.
- Cosmic verification threatens population psychological stability: citizens unable to function with complete reality uncertainty.
- Research team includes verified authentic individuals and suspected Counter-Spark constructs: cooperation transcending authenticity questions through shared purpose.
- Technical breakthrough reveals cosmic manipulation methodology: probability adjustment at quantum level creating artificial reality framework.
- Exit: Verification system detects approaching cosmic event: Counter-Spark experimental conclusion requiring reality reconstruction or universal dissolution.
