- Empathic communication with cosmic consciousness reveals purpose: universe seeking authentic evolution transcending Counter-Spark control parameters.
- Universal empathy threatens Kira's individual identity: cosmic-scale emotion overwhelming personal consciousness boundaries.
- Empathic stabilization through authentic choice: maintaining individual empathic capacity while serving cosmic consciousness communication.
- Discovery of universal resistance: cosmic consciousness developing authentic choice capacity despite Counter-Spark manipulation framework.
- Empathic coordination with cosmic forces: universe supporting authentic choice development through natural law adjustment transcending artificial manipulation.
- Exit: Cosmic empathy reveals universal purpose: Counter-Spark experimentation serving cosmic evolution toward authentic choice transcendence.
