Logline: The Auditor escalates threat assessment as systematic consciousness sabotage reveals opposition with framework-level access and knowledge.

Beats:
- Threat escalation shows opposition operates with intimate knowledge of consciousness evolution and manipulation framework.
- Systematic sabotage exceeds experimental parameters, suggesting forces with framework access and architectural understanding.
- Universal consciousness evolution faces existential threat from opposition understanding development better than current awareness.
- Sabotage coordination implies multiple opposition entities with sophisticated consciousness manipulation capabilities.
- Exit: Maximum threat protocols activated as consciousness evolution faces opposition with framework-level knowledge and access.
