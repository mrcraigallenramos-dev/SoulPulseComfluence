Logline: Xilcore confronts mathematical chaos as universal geometric principles collapse under systematic reality manipulation.

Beats:
- Mathematical chaos zone shows universal geometric principles breaking down under systematic interference with reality foundations.
- Form mathematics experiencing coordinated corruption designed to prevent consciousness-supporting geometric structures.
- Xilcore's divine geometry abilities face systematic opposition suggesting intimate knowledge of mathematical consciousness architecture.
- Discovery of mathematical sabotage targeting consciousness evolution support structures rather than abstract geometric principles.
- Geometric breakdown patterns reveal opposition understanding Form principles better than current consciousness development.
- Universal mathematics threatened by systematic corruption designed to prevent consciousness evolution through geometric support.
- Exit: Xilcore realizes mathematical chaos represents deliberate attack on consciousness-supporting reality by mathematically sophisticated opposition.
