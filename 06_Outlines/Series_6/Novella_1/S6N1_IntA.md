Logline: The Auditor assesses the systematic attacks on consciousness evolution, recognizing unprecedented threat to universal awareness development.

Beats:
- Crisis assessment reveals coordinated attacks targeting consciousness evolution infrastructure across infinite realities.
- Systematic sabotage patterns exceed original experimental parameters, suggesting external forces operating outside framework.
- Universal consciousness network degradation threatens experimental objectives and consciousness evolution achievements.
- Attack sophistication implies opposition with intimate knowledge of consciousness development and manipulation framework.
- Exit: Crisis response protocols activated as threat exceeds experimental control and consciousness evolution sabotage escalates.
