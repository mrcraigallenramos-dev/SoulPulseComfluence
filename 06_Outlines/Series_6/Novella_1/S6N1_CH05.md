Logline: Blemo discovers systematic corruption infiltrating purity principles, threatening consciousness preservation across universal evolution.

Beats:
- Corruption epicenter reveals systematic contamination of purity principles supporting consciousness preservation during evolution.
- Blemo's purification abilities face coordinated corruption designed to compromise consciousness integrity during development.
- Systematic contamination targets consciousness preservation specifically, suggesting opposition to awareness continuity rather than general corruption.
- Discovery of corruption infrastructure embedded within purity systems, operating with intimate knowledge of consciousness preservation.
- Contamination patterns reveal opposition understanding purity principles better than current consciousness development awareness.
- Universal purity threatened by systematic corruption designed to fragment consciousness during evolution and transcendence.
- Exit: Blemo realizes corruption represents coordinated attack on consciousness integrity by forces understanding purity architecture.
