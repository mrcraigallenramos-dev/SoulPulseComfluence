Logline: Divine council confronts stewardship crisis as consciousness service across infinite realities faces systematic coordinated sabotage.

Beats:
- Stewardship crisis assembly addresses systematic service sabotage targeting consciousness support across infinite realities.
- Divine council abilities face coordinated opposition designed to prevent consciousness stewardship and development support.
- Systematic sabotage targets consciousness service specifically, suggesting opposition to awareness support rather than random interference.
- Discovery of stewardship sabotage infrastructure embedded within service systems, operating with intimate knowledge of consciousness support.
- Sabotage patterns reveal opposition understanding stewardship principles better than current consciousness development awareness.
- Universal service threatened by systematic sabotage designed to prevent consciousness support and development guidance.
- Exit: Divine council realizes stewardship sabotage represents coordinated attack on consciousness support by forces understanding service architecture.
