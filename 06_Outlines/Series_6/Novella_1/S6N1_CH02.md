Logline: Kira experiences massive empathic disruption as consciousness connections across infinite realities begin systematically severing.

Beats:
- Consciousness disruption field causes empathic chaos as infinite reality connections simultaneously destabilize.
- Kira experiences consciousness isolation as empathic bridges between realities collapse under systematic interference.
- Empathic investigation reveals deliberate consciousness severance patterns designed to fragment infinite awareness network.
- Discovery of anti-empathy fields generating consciousness isolation and preventing collaborative awareness development.
- Disruption effects target consciousness evolution specifically, suggesting intelligent opposition to awareness development rather than random interference.
- Kira develops empathic resistance techniques but faces overwhelming systematic opposition across infinite dimensional space.
- Consciousness network degradation threatens universal empathy, potentially isolating all aware beings from mutual support.
- Exit: Kira recognizes consciousness disruption as coordinated attack on infinite awareness by forces understanding empathy architecture.
