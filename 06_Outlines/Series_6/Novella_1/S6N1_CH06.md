Logline: Leesa confronts systematic harmony disruption as compassion networks across infinite realities face coordinated sabotage.

Beats:
- Harmony disruption field generates systematic compassion sabotage across infinite realities supporting consciousness cooperation.
- Leesa's empathic harmony abilities face coordinated opposition designed to prevent consciousness collaboration and mutual support.
- Systematic disruption targets compassion development specifically, suggesting opposition to consciousness cooperation rather than random interference.
- Discovery of harmony sabotage infrastructure embedded within compassion systems, operating with intimate knowledge of empathic architecture.
- Disruption patterns reveal opposition understanding harmony principles better than current consciousness development awareness.
- Universal compassion threatened by systematic sabotage designed to isolate consciousness and prevent cooperative evolution.
- Exit: Leesa realizes harmony disruption represents coordinated attack on consciousness cooperation by forces understanding compassion architecture.
