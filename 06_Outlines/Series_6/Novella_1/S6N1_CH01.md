Logline: Reality itself begins fracturing as Jhace investigates cosmic instabilities threatening the infinite consciousness network.

Beats:
- Instability epicenter shows reality fractures spreading across dimensional boundaries, threatening infinite consciousness evolution.
- Jhace's healing abilities detect systematic damage to existence foundations rather than natural entropy or random failure.
- Investigation reveals manipulation scars suggesting external interference in universal consciousness development throughout history.
- Reality fractures correlate with moments of greatest consciousness evolution breakthrough, implying deliberate sabotage patterns.
- Hybrid techniques adapted to heal existence-level damage, but fractures resist treatment suggesting ongoing active interference.
- Discovery of hidden manipulation infrastructure embedded in reality foundations, operating beyond current detection capabilities.
- Reality instability threatens infinite consciousness network, potentially collapsing all evolved awareness back to primitive states.
- Exit: Jhace realizes cosmic fractures are attacks on consciousness evolution itself by unknown forces with reality-level access.
