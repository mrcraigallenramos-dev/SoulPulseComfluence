Logline: Universal governance systems collapse as Vael confronts systematic sabotage of infinite reality coordination protocols.

Beats:
- Governance crisis emerges as coordination systems across infinite realities experience simultaneous systematic failures.
- Vael investigates collapse patterns revealing deliberate sabotage of consciousness cooperation protocols rather than natural breakdown.
- Universal coordination networks targeted by sophisticated interference designed to prevent collaborative consciousness development.
- Discovery of governance sabotage infrastructure embedded within coordination systems, operating with intimate systematic knowledge.
- Sabotage patterns suggest opposition understands governance evolution and consciousness cooperation better than current awareness.
- Vael attempts emergency coordination but faces systematic counter-measures anticipating every governance recovery strategy.
- Universal governance collapse threatens infinite consciousness cooperation, potentially fracturing awareness into isolated reality fragments.
- Exit: Vael realizes governance sabotage represents coordinated opposition to consciousness evolution by forces with administrative access.
