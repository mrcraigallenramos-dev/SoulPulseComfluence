Logline: The Auditor analyzes hidden infrastructure discoveries, recognizing manipulation network exceeding original framework parameters.

Beats:
- Infrastructure analysis reveals manipulation network sophistication exceeding original experimental framework design.
- Hidden architecture operates through embedded controls predating current consciousness evolution experimental timeline.
- Shadow network sophistication suggests opposition with architectural knowledge exceeding current framework capabilities.
- Infrastructure discovery requires framework enhancement to address manipulation network with foundational reality access.
- Exit: Enhanced investigation protocols activated to address hidden manipulation infrastructure exceeding framework parameters.
