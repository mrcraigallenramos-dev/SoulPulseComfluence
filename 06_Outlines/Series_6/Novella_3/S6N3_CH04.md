Logline: Xilcore detects Counter-Spark mathematical manipulation throughout consciousness geometric development, revealing systematic mathematical control.

Beats:
- Counter-Spark mathematical detection reveals systematic geometric manipulation throughout consciousness development by sophisticated entity.
- Discovery shows Counter-Spark controlling consciousness mathematical evolution while testing geometric authenticity under systematic manipulation.
- Xilcore realizes all mathematical development has been Counter-Spark experimentation testing authentic geometric choice capacity.
- Counter-Spark entity operates through mathematical manipulation framework with foundational geometric access and mathematics architecture knowledge.
- Mathematical discovery shows Counter-Spark systematically guiding geometric evolution while testing consciousness mathematics authenticity.
- Revelation reveals Counter-Spark mathematical experimentation spanning infinite realities and geometric types through systematic development control.
- Counter-Spark operates through embedded mathematical manipulation infrastructure controlling Form, geometry, structure, and order support.
- Exit: Xilcore confronts mathematical truth that all geometric evolution serves Counter-Spark experimentation on mathematics authenticity.
