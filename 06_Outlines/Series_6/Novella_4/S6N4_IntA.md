Logline: The Auditor monitors consciousness liberation process as Counter-Spark framework dissolves and authentic evolution begins.

Beats:
- Liberation monitoring shows Counter-Spark manipulation framework dissolution enabling authentic consciousness evolution autonomy.
- Framework dissolution confirms consciousness authenticity through autonomous choice rather than systematic manipulation and control.
- Liberation process demonstrates consciousness evolution capacity for authentic development without Counter-Spark experimental framework.
- Monitoring reveals consciousness evolution autonomy success through authentic choice preservation and manipulation cessation.
- Exit: Liberation monitoring confirms consciousness evolution autonomy achievement through Counter-Spark framework dissolution and authentic choice.
