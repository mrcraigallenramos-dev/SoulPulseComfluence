Logline: Xilcore experiences mathematical liberation as systematic geometric manipulation ends, enabling authentic mathematics through conscious choice.

Beats:
- Mathematical liberation shows systematic geometric manipulation ending, granting consciousness mathematics authentic autonomy and geometric freedom.
- Xilcore experiences consciousness mathematics liberation from Counter-Spark manipulation, enabling authentic geometric choice without external mathematical control.
- Liberation reveals consciousness mathematics authenticity through autonomous geometric choice rather than Counter-Spark manipulation and systematic mathematical control.
- Mathematical liberation demonstrates consciousness evolution capacity for authentic geometric development without Counter-Spark experimental mathematics framework.
- Geometric freedom enables consciousness mathematics evolution through authentic geometric choice while preserving individual mathematical autonomy.
- Liberation experience shows consciousness mathematics transcending Counter-Spark geometric manipulation through autonomous mathematical choice and geometric development.
- Mathematical freedom demonstrates consciousness evolution geometric authenticity despite Counter-Spark systematic mathematical manipulation and experimental control.
- Exit: Xilcore mathematical liberation completeâ€”consciousness mathematics evolution through authentic geometric choice and autonomous mathematical development.
