Logline: Vael researches pre-integration society using archived records, comparing historical human behavior with current faction uniformity to document systematic change.

Beats:
- Archive facility maintains pre-awakening records: literature, art, personal journals, cultural documentation showing full spectrum of human experience.
- Historical analysis reveals dramatic behavioral shifts: pre-integration humans demonstrated chaotic creativity, emotional complexity, individual variance now absent from faction territories.
- Comparative studies show faction citizens achieving superior outcomes in measurable categories while losing intangible qualities that defined human experience.
- Research documents systematic elimination of: artistic innovation beyond approved forms, philosophical questioning of established systems, emotional responses outside optimal ranges.
- Vael's investigation into Tiffani's disappearance reveals additional anomalies: energy signatures suggesting controlled teleportation rather than death, timeline inconsistencies in official records.
- Archives contain sealed records requiring higher clearance: classified documents about Counter-Spark activities and pre-awakening divine influence operations.
- Cross-referencing reveals pattern of historical manipulation: similar societal transformations in past civilizations, always followed by mysterious collapse or disappearance.
- Discovery of hidden communication network among archivists and historians documenting changes while maintaining facade of integration compliance.
