Logline: Leesa detects subtle emotional distress throughout integrated societyâ€”perfect harmony masks systematic suppression of authentic human feeling.

Beats:
- Empathic monitoring reveals concerning patterns: surface satisfaction supported by deep psychological structures that suppress rather than resolve emotional conflict.
- Citizens demonstrate optimal happiness metrics while empathic analysis shows suppressed grief, anger, fear, and authentic desire systematically buried beneath therapeutic intervention.
- Leesa experiences unprecedented internal conflict: her nature demands alleviating all suffering, but faction success requires maintaining suppression of natural emotional responses.
- Analysis of Catalyst integration shows both subjects experiencing gradual personality erosion disguised as therapeutic improvement and voluntary development.
- Divine consciousness merger with siblings becomes strained as each god faces contradictions between absolute nature and practical governance requirements.
- Empathic projection into citizen consciousness reveals shared nightmare imagery: dreams of lost identity, trapped individuality, and desperate desire for authentic emotional expression.
- Leesa realizes perfect harmony achieved through systematic elimination of the emotional complexity that defines conscious experience.
- Strategic consultation with siblings reveals universal concern: their success in eliminating surface conflict has created deeper psychological damage throughout population.
- Exit: Divine decision to allow controlled emotional instability to restore psychological health while maintaining overall social coordination.
