Logline: Blemo analyzes integration success but recognizes that perfect purity has eliminated the imperfection necessary for growth and adaptation.

Beats:
- Research data confirms optimal outcomes across all measured categories: disease eliminated, mental illness cured, social dysfunction corrected through systematic intervention.
- Clinical analysis reveals concerning pattern: eliminated "impurities" included emotional complexity, creative chaos, and individual variance that serve essential biological functions.
- Blemo experiences divine cognitive dissonance: absolute purity achieved at cost of eliminating the creative imperfection that drives evolution and adaptation.
- Population studies show declining innovation, reduced problem-solving ability, and loss of adaptive resilience despite optimal health and happiness metrics.
- Consultation with siblings reveals universal concern: each god's absolute success has eliminated the balance necessary for continued cosmic function.
- Strategic assessment indicates need for controlled introduction of managed impurity to restore population's adaptive capabilities while maintaining health improvements.
- Divine recognition that perfect purity, like perfect order and harmony, becomes destructive when achieved without balancing opposition.
- Exit: Authorization for "therapeutic imperfection" protocols designed to restore necessary human variance while preserving medical achievements.
