Logline: Both Catalysts work to restore their suppressed abilities while preparing for coordinated action that will expose faction control to integrated population.

Beats:
- Secret facility equipped with pre-integration technology allows experimentation with ability restoration without faction detection.
- Systematic analysis reveals extent of their suppression: hybrid abilities limited to approved therapeutic applications while disruptive potential eliminated.
- Restoration process requires confronting integration trauma: recognizing voluntary acceptance of limitation disguised as personal growth and community service.
- Recovery of suppressed memories reveals manipulation during integration ceremony: personality modification presented as willing therapeutic improvement.
- Ability restoration creates cognitive dissonance: returning to pre-integration power levels while maintaining facade of satisfied integration.
- Coordination of restored abilities reveals potential for systematic disruption of faction control mechanisms without causing population collapse.
- Strategic planning for revelation event: using hybrid abilities to temporarily disable neurological suppression systems throughout faction territories.
- Personal reconciliation with integration experience: accepting responsibility for voluntary submission while recognizing sophisticated manipulation.
- Exit: Both Catalysts prepared for coordinated action while gods simultaneously prepare for managed chaos introductionâ€”timing becomes critical.
