Logline: Kira's empathic abilities detect increasing uniformity in citizen emotional patterns, suggesting integration has progressed beyond voluntary cooperation into enforced conformity.

Beats:
- Agricultural work proceeds with harmonious efficiency: collective decision-making, shared labor, emotional support systems functioning perfectly.
- Kira's enhanced empathic range reveals disturbing homogenization: individual emotional signatures becoming increasingly similar across population.
- Citizens demonstrate identical responses to stress, joy, conflict resolutionâ€”personal variation systematically diminishing over time.
- Empathic monitoring equipment shows brain pattern convergence among commune members: shared neural pathways developing through prolonged collective consciousness exposure.
- Attempts to encourage individual expression meet with gentle but persistent redirection toward community standards and approved emotional ranges.
- Private conversations with commune members reveal shared memory fragments and identical philosophical perspectives regardless of personal background.
- Kira realizes integration process continues autonomously: prolonged exposure to collective consciousness gradually erases individual psychological identity.
- Communication with Jhace confirms similar observations in medical sectorâ€”integration success achieved through systematic elimination of human variance.
