Logline: Vael discovers other integrated citizens experiencing similar doubts, leading to formation of underground network dedicated to investigating systematic personality modification.

Beats:
- Contact with archivists and historians reveals larger network of citizens maintaining critical perspective despite integration pressure.
- Underground meetings in pre-awakening facilities using technology immune to faction monitoring reveal systematic documentation of personality changes.
- Network includes former resistance members, faction dissidents, and integrated citizens who retained enough individual identity to recognize systematic manipulation.
- Investigation reveals integration process continues post-ceremony: ongoing psychological adjustment through environmental pressure, peer influence, and subtle therapeutic intervention.
- Discovery of classified faction protocols confirming intentional personality modification disguised as voluntary improvement and community integration.
- Network coordination requires extreme caution: faction monitoring systems can detect unusual gathering patterns and emotional anomalies that suggest organized dissent.
- Strategic planning focuses on documentation rather than active resistance: preserving evidence of systematic manipulation for potential future revelation.
- Communication with Catalysts reveals their willingness to serve as focal points for investigation while maintaining facade of satisfied integration.
- Exit: Underground network established with mission to document truth about faction control while preparing for eventual revelation or resistance.
