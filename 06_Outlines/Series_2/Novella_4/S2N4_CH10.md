Logline: Seeri deliberately introduces controlled chaos into integrated systems to test their resilience and restore necessary cosmic balance.

Beats:
- Entropy acceleration projects target faction infrastructure: carefully planned system failures designed to create manageable challenges without catastrophic damage.
- Citizens respond to controlled chaos with unexpected rigidity: integration has eliminated adaptive flexibility necessary for handling unpredictable situations.
- Seeri observes faction response to minor system failures reveals brittle optimization: perfect efficiency that collapses when confronted with any deviation.
- Divine analysis confirms concern: integrated society lacks resilience necessary for long-term survival in unpredictable universe.
- Acceleration experiments reveal citizens' dependence on faction systems for basic decision-making: individual initiative systematically eliminated through therapeutic improvement.
- Seeri recognizes necessity of introducing greater instability to restore population's adaptive capabilities while risking integration collapse.
- Coordination with siblings shows universal agreement: perfect success has created dangerous vulnerability requiring controlled introduction of managed failure.
- Strategic planning for managed system stress designed to restore citizen autonomy while maintaining overall social stability.
- Exit: Authorization for "therapeutic chaos" protocols designed to rebuild individual resilience through carefully controlled challenges.
