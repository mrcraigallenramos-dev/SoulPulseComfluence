Logline: Three years after integration, Jhace works within faction medical systems but discovers subtle anomalies suggesting the harmony isn't as perfect as it appears.

Beats:
- Medical center operates with geometric precision: optimal patient flow, mathematical treatment protocols, perfect resource allocationâ€”yet something feels hollow.
- Jhace's hybrid abilities detect emotional discordance beneath surface satisfaction: patients smile but their resonance patterns suggest suppressed anxiety.
- Treatment protocols forbid addressing psychological distress that doesn't align with faction happiness metricsâ€”symptoms managed rather than causes explored.
- Colleagues demonstrate perfect cooperation but lack genuine spontaneity: conversations follow predictable patterns, creativity channeled into approved forms.
- Patient consultation reveals concerning pattern: citizens report identical dreams and shared thought fragments suggesting deeper mental integration than advertised.
- Medical ethics conflict with faction efficiency: optimal outcomes achieved through methods that minimize individual agency and authentic choice.
- Jhace attempts to address concerns through proper channels but finds criticism deflected with patient explanations and therapeutic recommendations.
- Underground conversation with Kira reveals she's noticed similar patterns in her sectorâ€”integration success masks systematic suppression of authentic human variance.
