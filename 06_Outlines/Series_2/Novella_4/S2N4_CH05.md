Logline: Jhace and Kira meet secretly to compare observations and realize their integration was designed to eliminate their disruptive potential while preserving their useful abilities.

Beats:
- Clandestine meeting in abandoned pre-integration facility using resonance dampeners to avoid detection by faction monitoring systems.
- Information sharing reveals systematic patterns: both observe emotional uniformity, creative suppression, and gradual elimination of individual psychological variance.
- Analysis of their integration process shows careful manipulation: allowed to retain hybrid abilities while eliminating capacity for effective opposition or systematic criticism.
- Realization that their roles as "constructive critics" within faction systems serve to legitimize oppression by providing facade of internal dissent and reform.
- Review of integration ceremony reveals memory gaps and personality modifications they previously attributed to voluntary therapeutic improvement.
- Discovery that their continued friendship and coordination was planned: controlled opposition that channels dissent into harmless internal debate.
- Strategic assessment of faction vulnerability reveals potential pressure points: divine coordination dependent on continued cosmic stability and citizen satisfaction.
- Decision to begin subtle investigation of integration process while maintaining facade of compliance and satisfaction with current roles.
- Exit: Both Catalysts committed to discovering truth about their transformation while avoiding detection by increasingly sophisticated monitoring systems.
