Logline: Underground network prepares for systematic revelation of faction control mechanisms while gods simultaneously plan introduction of managed chaos.

Beats:
- Network intelligence reveals faction leadership planning significant changes: controlled introduction of instability to address integration brittleness.
- Strategic assessment shows convergence of resistance goals and divine concerns: both recognize need for restoring authentic human agency and adaptive capability.
- Vael's investigation into Tiffani's disappearance reveals final pieces: energy signature analysis confirms survival and suggests ongoing involvement in cosmic manipulation.
- Network coordination with Catalysts reveals divine preparation for managed revelation: gods planning to expose their own control systems to restore cosmic balance.
- Intelligence sharing shows faction territories simultaneously experiencing minor system failures designed to test citizen adaptability and restore individual initiative.
- Preparation for revelation campaign designed to maximize citizen awakening while minimizing social collapse and infrastructure damage.
- Strategic alliance consideration: whether to coordinate with divine "therapeutic chaos" or maintain independent revelation timeline.
- Network decision to proceed with coordinated revelation while maintaining independence from divine planning and manipulation.
- Exit: Final preparations for systematic exposure of faction control mechanisms while gods simultaneously prepare for managed chaos introduction.
