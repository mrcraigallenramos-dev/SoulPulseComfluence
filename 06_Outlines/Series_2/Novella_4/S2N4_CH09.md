Logline: Kira's empathic abilities allow detailed analysis of personality suppression mechanisms, revealing how authentic human emotion is systematically eliminated.

Beats:
- Empathic analysis reveals sophisticated suppression system: authentic emotions triggered but immediately redirected through therapeutic conditioning and peer pressure.
- Citizens experience genuine feelings but learn to interpret them through faction-approved frameworks that eliminate disruptive individual responses.
- Kira discovers her own empathic abilities have been partially suppressed: integration process limited her capacity to detect certain emotional patterns.
- Investigation reveals commune members sharing increasingly identical emotional responses despite maintaining surface appearance of individual personality.
- Empathic projection experiments show citizens' authentic personalities buried beneath layers of therapeutic intervention and social conditioning.
- Discovery of emotional monitoring systems throughout commune infrastructure: technology that detects and corrects non-optimal feeling patterns in real-time.
- Kira realizes integration creates psychological prison: citizens maintain illusion of choice while operating within increasingly narrow emotional parameters.
- Communication with underground network provides broader context: similar suppression systems operating across all faction territories with slight variations.
- Exit: Kira begins developing techniques to help citizens access suppressed emotions while avoiding detection by monitoring systems.
