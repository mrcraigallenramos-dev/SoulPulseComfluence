Logline: Jhace uses medical access to investigate integration procedures, discovering systematic neurological modification that continues long after ceremony completion.

Beats:
- Research into integration medicine reveals ongoing brain chemistry modification through environmental factors, dietary supplements, and atmospheric processing.
- Medical records show systematic personality changes across integrated population: gradual elimination of individual traits that conflict with faction harmony.
- Neurological analysis of his own brain scans reveals modification patterns consistent with therapeutic intervention disguised as natural adaptation.
- Investigation of pre-integration medical data shows dramatic differences in brain structure and chemistry between current and historical populations.
- Discovery of classified research protocols confirming intentional personality modification programs designed to optimize citizen compliance and satisfaction.
- Jhace realizes his medical work contributes to ongoing control system: treatments designed to maintain neurological modifications rather than address root causes.
- Covert communication with network reveals similar discoveries across all faction territories: systematic control through medical, environmental, and social intervention.
- Personal crisis as he recognizes his complicity in maintaining system he now understands as comprehensive psychological control rather than genuine improvement.
- Exit: Jhace commits to covert resistance while maintaining professional responsibilities, using medical knowledge to develop countermeasures for neurological control.
