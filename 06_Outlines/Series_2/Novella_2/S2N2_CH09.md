Logline: Divine factions shift strategy from direct confrontation to systematic pressureâ€”dismantling resistance infrastructure to force Jhace into faction protection.

Beats:
- Intelligence networks report coordinated faction operations targeting resistance safe houses, supply lines, and communication systems.
- Each god contributes specialized expertise: Form disrupts infrastructure, Harmony converts key personnel, Purity eliminates disease resistance, Decay accelerates equipment failure.
- Vael realizes the factions have learned from failed direct approachesâ€”psychological warfare proves more effective than military force against the Catalyst.
- Safe house locations become compromised through converted resistance members who retain operational knowledge while serving faction interests.
- Medical supplies become contaminated or scarce, forcing difficult choices between treating patients and maintaining operational security.
- Communication networks fail as faction forces demonstrate ability to coordinate efforts without relying on interceptable methods.
- Civilian populations in neutral zones face increasing pressure to join factions for basic necessitiesâ€”neutrality becomes economically unsustainable.
- Vael's team begins showing stress fractures as constant pressure and resource limitations wear down morale and tactical effectiveness.
- Strategic assessment reveals factions are succeedingâ€”resistance capability degrading faster than they can adapt or rebuild.
