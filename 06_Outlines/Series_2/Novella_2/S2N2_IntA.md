Logline: Xilcore coordinates with his divine siblings for the first time since awakeningâ€”their competing principles must align for the Convergence Protocol to succeed.

Beats:
- Divine summit in folded space where four perfect domains intersect: geometric order, empathic harmony, sterile purity, beautiful decay.
- Each god has claimed territories and converted millions, but their competing natures create friction that limits expansionâ€”cooperation becomes necessary.
- Strategic objective revealed: the Convergence Protocol requires all four divine principles channeled simultaneously through willing hybrid resonance.
- Jhace remains the only mortal capable of stable multi-principle resonance, but his psychological resistance prevents direct conquest or conversion.
- Xilcore proposes systematic pressure: isolate him from support systems, present faction membership as the only path to protecting others.
- Divine negotiation reveals ancient cosmic mechanics: their awakening has destabilized universal balance, requiring either total victory or coordinated return to dormancy.
- Agreement reached: shared custody of the Catalyst, with each god contributing expertise while maintaining territorial sovereignty.
- Exit: Orders issued to cease inter-faction warfare and begin coordinated Jhace acquisitionâ€”the hunt becomes systematic rather than competitive.
