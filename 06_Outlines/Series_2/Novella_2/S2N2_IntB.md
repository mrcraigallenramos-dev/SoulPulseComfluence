Logline: The Auditor evaluates divine coordination emergence while adjusting manipulation parameters for optimal experimental outcomes.

Beats:
- Divine cooperation metrics show unprecedented coordination efficiency - gods learning tactical alliance despite competitive natures.
- Subject analysis reveals dual Catalyst emergence provides redundancy in strategic assets while multiplying manipulation opportunities.
- Faction programming evolution tracked through behavioral modification success rates and citizen conversion stability metrics.
- Resistance network development proceeds within acceptable parameters - providing opposition without threatening experimental framework integrity.
- Statistical projections indicate divine cooperation creates enhanced manipulation opportunities through coordinated pressure application.
- Probability adjustment protocols maintain optimal balance between divine success and mortal resistance capability.
- Exit: Experimental framework adaptation continues as subject variables approach critical manipulation thresholds.
