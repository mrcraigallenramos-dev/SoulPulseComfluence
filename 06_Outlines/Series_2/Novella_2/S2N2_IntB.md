Logline: Seeri alone among the gods embraces the Catalyst's resistance as necessary frictionâ€”she begins subtle sabotage of sibling cooperation.

Beats:
- Meditation among ruins where beauty emerges from breakdownâ€”Seeri finds wisdom in accepting rather than controlling the Catalyst's choices.
- Strategic analysis reveals her siblings' cooperation threatens cosmic balance by eliminating the creative friction that drives universal evolution.
- She recognizes the Catalyst's refusal as echo of her own divine natureâ€”necessary opposition that prevents stagnation and maintains dynamic equilibrium.
- Seeri begins subtle interference with sibling operations: delayed communications, resource shortages, tactical advice that seems helpful but creates complications.
- Her followers receive cryptic instructions to protect the Catalyst through indirect meansâ€”shields he will never see but will benefit from.
- Divine contemplation of endings reveals truth: the Convergence Protocol might succeed but would create static perfection that ultimately leads to universal death.
- She chooses cosmic health over divine victory, accepting personal isolation from her siblings as necessary sacrifice for greater balance.
- Orders issued to her cult networks: maintain apparent cooperation while ensuring the Catalyst retains freedom to choose his own path.
