Logline: Jhace and Kira work together to liberate converts from a faction facility, proving that divine programming can be reversed and human agency restored.

Beats:
- Infiltration reveals facility designed to optimize human potential through divine programmingâ€”converts work with perfect efficiency but no personal motivation.
- Kira's abilities detect residual human consciousness buried beneath divine programming while Jhace's experience provides techniques for careful reversal.
- Liberation process requires delicate balance: too gentle leaves programming intact, too aggressive causes psychological damage or identity death.
- First successful reversals create hope but also reveal the depth of faction integrationâ€”converts have lived months or years with altered identity.
- Some converts choose to return to faction service after experiencing both optionsâ€”freedom includes right to choose servitude.
- Facility defenders show reluctance to use lethal force against liberators, suggesting divine programming maintains human conscience at some level.
- Mission succeeds in freeing dozens of converts but alerts factions to vulnerability in their programming techniques.
- Liberated converts provide intelligence about Convergence Protocol facilities and divine long-term planningâ€”strategic intelligence bonanza.
- Both Catalysts experience growth in ability coordination and tactical effectiveness through working together rather than in isolation.
- Exit: Victory celebration tempered by knowledge that factions will adapt their programming to prevent future reversalsâ€”arms race between freedom and control.
