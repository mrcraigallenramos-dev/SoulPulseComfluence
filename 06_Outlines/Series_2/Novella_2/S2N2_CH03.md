Logline: For the first time, all four factions approach Jhace with coordinated offers rather than competing demandsâ€”their unity terrifies him more than their opposition.

Beats:
- Representatives from all four factions arrive simultaneously with matching proposals: join willingly, receive protection for his patients, contribute to cosmic stability.
- Form delegate offers technological paradise: perfect medical facilities, unlimited resources, optimal patient outcomes through geometric precision.
- Harmony representative promises emotional peace: no more guilt over Tiffani, no more isolation, perfect empathic connection with all he serves.
- Purity advocate guarantees clean solutions: diseases eliminated, suffering purged, moral complexity reduced to clear right and wrong.
- Decay cultist embraces endings: Tiffani's death accepted, grief transformed to wisdom, beauty found in loss and impermanence.
- Each offer addresses his genuine needs and desires, but requires surrendering different aspects of his humanity and autonomous choice.
- The hybrid child from Chapter 1 manifests dangerous resonance spikes during the negotiationâ€”her instability mirrors his own internal conflict.
- Jhace realizes the coordinated approach means the gods fear him enough to cooperateâ€”his resistance has become a strategic threat.
- He refuses all offers but understands his neutrality is endingâ€”the factions will not accept indefinite delay.
