Logline: Vael's resistance network has grown but faces systematic infiltration and conversion by divine factionsâ€”the war for human agency enters its critical phase.

Beats:
- Command bunker carved from pre-awakening infrastructure, shielded by overlapping Faraday cages and resonance scramblers built from scavenged technology.
- Intelligence reports show accelerating conversion rates: 60% of population now serves divine factions, with psychological integration deepening monthly.
- Resistance cells operate in shrinking neutral zones, relying on pre-awakening technology and careful coordination to avoid magical detection.
- Infiltration problems multiply: converts retain memories and relationships but serve faction interests with absolute loyaltyâ€”trust becomes impossible.
- Her investigation into Tiffani's death reveals more anomalies: energy readings suggest controlled teleportation rather than obliteration, but she keeps suspicions classified.
- Strategic analysis indicates the factions are building toward something requiring massive coordinated effortâ€”convergence facilities appearing at resonance nexus points.
- A promising resistance leader reveals faction loyalty mid-operation, forcing Vael to kill someone she trained and trustedâ€”the personal cost of endless war.
- New intelligence places Jhace at the center of faction attention again; Vael must choose between his protection and broader resistance objectives.
