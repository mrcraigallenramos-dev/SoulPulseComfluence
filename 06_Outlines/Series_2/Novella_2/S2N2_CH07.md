Logline: Sheltered by Vael's network, Jhace trains Kira while grappling with the responsibility of mentoring someone with his same destructive potential.

Beats:
- Underground facility equipped with resonance dampeners and pre-awakening medical equipment repurposed for magical training and containment.
- Kira's training reveals the emotional foundations of hybrid resonance: Form requires intellectual clarity, Wholeness demands empathic openness.
- Teaching her control forces Jhace to examine his own techniquesâ€”he realizes his abilities remain partially instinctive and emotionally driven.
- Other resistance members watch their training with mixture of hope and terrorâ€”two people capable of reshaping reality practicing in confined spaces.
- Kira's parents struggle with her transformation, grieving the normal childhood stolen by awakened abilities while fearing her potential for destruction.
- Training sessions reveal Kira can access memories embedded in her hybrid resonanceâ€”glimpses of the original awakening event and divine consciousness.
- Her abilities stabilize when focused on healing and protection but become chaotic when she attempts offensive applications.
- Jhace realizes teaching her means accepting responsibility for how she uses powerâ€”mentorship carries moral weight he tried to avoid.
- Intelligence reports indicate faction forces have ceased active search operations, suggesting shift to different acquisition strategy.
