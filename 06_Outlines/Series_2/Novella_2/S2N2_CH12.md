Logline: With two active Catalysts and coordinated divine opposition, Vael must evolve resistance strategy beyond simple survival toward active disruption of divine plans.

Beats:
- Post-crisis analysis reveals both opportunities and threats: two Catalysts provide tactical advantages but also increase divine attention and resource requirements.
- Intelligence assessment shows faction coordination is imperfectâ€”each god's absolute nature creates friction that resistance can exploit.
- Kira's stabilized abilities offer new capabilities: her resonance can disrupt divine communications and create zones of magical unpredictability.
- Strategic planning involves training both Catalysts in coordinated techniques while maintaining their individual autonomy and decision-making authority.
- Vael's team develops new operational protocols based on magical support rather than purely technological approachesâ€”adaptation to post-awakening warfare.
- Network expansion becomes possible as Kira's abilities can detect converted personnel and distinguish genuine loyalty from divine programming.
- Resource allocation shifts toward supporting Catalyst operations while maintaining traditional resistance infrastructure for non-magical personnel.
- Long-term objectives evolve from survival toward active disruption: preventing Convergence Protocol requires offensive operations against divine facilities.
- Exit: First joint operation authorizedâ€”Catalysts and resistance working together to liberate faction converts and demonstrate possibility of reversing divine programming.
