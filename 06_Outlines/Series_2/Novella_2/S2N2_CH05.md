Logline: Vael's team attempts to extract Jhace and Kira while four divine factions coordinate their first joint military operationâ€”cooperation makes them far more dangerous.

Beats:
- Siege perimeter established with geometric precision: Form forces control infrastructure, Harmony manages civilian evacuation, Purity sterilizes approach routes, Decay eliminates escape vectors.
- Each faction contributes specialized capabilities to a coordinated wholeâ€”their cooperation demonstrates evolution beyond competitive recruitment.
- Vael's resistance team faces opponents who share intelligence and tactical coordination while maintaining their individual strengths and covering each other's weaknesses.
- Evacuation attempts fail as Harmony operatives pacify civilians into compliance while Form engineers redirect all transportation toward faction processing centers.
- Kira's continuing resonance cascades disrupt faction coordination by creating unpredictable environmental effects that interfere with both magical and technological systems.
- Jhace refuses extraction without guaranteeing safety for all clinic patients, creating tactical complexity that limits Vael's operational options.
- During battle, Vael observes faction forces showing unprecedented disciplineâ€”individual glory suppressed in favor of shared objectives.
- Her team's pre-awakening weapons and tactics prove less effective against coordinated divine opposition than against individual faction forces.
- Exit: Breakthrough achieved through Kira's uncontrolled abilities creating dimensional distortions that faction forces cannot predict or counter.
