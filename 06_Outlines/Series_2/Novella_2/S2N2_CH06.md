Logline: Leesa experiences her first major failure as the Catalyst's resistance disrupts her perfect harmonyâ€”his refusal to submit creates cognitive dissonance in her divine certainty.

Beats:
- Collective consciousness reports anomalous data: the Catalyst's hybrid resonance continues strengthening despite isolation and pressure.
- Leesa's certainty in universal harmony wavers as Jhace demonstrates that suffering can coexist with strength, that pain can serve growth rather than requiring elimination.
- Her followers begin exhibiting stress reactions to the failed acquisitionâ€”perfect peace proves fragile when confronted with genuine resistance.
- Strategic analysis reveals the Catalyst's bond with the hybrid child creates emotional leverage, but exploiting it would require causing harm she cannot reconcile.
- Internal divine debate: whether mercy is weakness or necessary component of true harmonyâ€”her absolute nature conflicts with tactical requirements.
- Communication with sibling gods reveals similar strugglesâ€”their cooperation succeeds tactically but creates philosophical tensions.
- She attempts direct empathic contact with Jhace during his dreams, offering to share his grief and guilt rather than eliminate it.
- The contact backfires as his hybrid nature reflects her empathy back amplified, forcing her to experience the full weight of faction casualties.
- Exit: Leesa withdraws from joint operations to process unprecedented doubt about the moral foundation of her divine mission.
