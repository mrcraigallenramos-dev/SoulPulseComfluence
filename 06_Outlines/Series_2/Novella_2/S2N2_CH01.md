Logline: Eighteen months after the Fathombreak, Jhace works as a roving medic in contested industrial zones, but divine faction control has tightenedâ€”neutrality grows impossible.

Beats:
- Factory district scarred by faction wars; Jhace's mobile clinic treats casualties from all sides with careful political neutrality.
- Form Consortium territories show geometric perfection: straight roads, optimized workflows, workers moving in mathematical precisionâ€”humanity drained for efficiency.
- Harmony Collective zones hum with unified purpose: shared thoughts, communal decision-making, individual voices fading into collective whisper.
- Purity Order enclaves gleam sterile white: disease eliminated, but so are gut bacteria, emotional complexity, and creative chaos.
- Decay Cults thrive in ruins: beautiful entropy, artistic destruction, life feeding on deathâ€”but also hopelessness and nihilistic violence.
- A critically injured child manifests unstable hybrid resonance like Jhace'sâ€”the first he's encountered; her survival requires risky techniques.
- Divine faction scouts converge on his clinic drawn by the hybrid signature; Jhace must choose between hiding and defending his patients.
