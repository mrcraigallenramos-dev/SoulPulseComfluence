Logline: Blemo prepares contingency protocols for forced Convergence while struggling with the moral implications of using coercion against someone whose resistance has proven philosophically challenging.

Beats:
- Research data confirms Catalyst's hybrid nature cannot be artificially replicatedâ€”attempts to create synthetic alternatives result in unstable resonance and subject termination.
- Analysis of the hybrid child's abilities suggests multiple Catalysts might be possible, but development requires decades of careful nurturing rather than forced conversion.
- Blemo faces divine cognitive dissonance: his nature demands elimination of impurity, but the Catalyst's hybrid nature might represent necessary cosmic balance rather than contamination.
- Preparation of Convergence chambers designed to channel divine energy through unwilling subjectsâ€”efficiency over consent, but unprecedented moral complexity for absolute principles.
- His clinicians report psychological stress from developing coercion protocolsâ€”even converted humans retain enough conscience to feel moral injury.
- Strategic consultation with siblings reveals each god faces similar internal conflicts between divine nature and tactical requirements.
- Blemo authorizes development of "mercy protocols" that minimize suffering during forced Convergenceâ€”his first compromise with absolute principles.
- Research into the original awakening event suggests the Catalyst's resistance serves cosmic functionâ€”his opposition might be necessary rather than obstacle.
- Exit: Orders issued to suspend direct acquisition attempts in favor of psychological pressureâ€”break his support network to make submission seem like mercy.
