Logline: As faction pressure collapses resistance infrastructure, Kira's abilities surge beyond controlâ€”her resonance cascade threatens to repeat Jhace's original awakening.

Beats:
- Facility systems fail under coordinated faction assault: power grids collapse, water supplies contaminated, communication arrays jammed.
- Kira's emotional distress at witnessing suffering triggers uncontrolled hybrid resonance that begins reshaping local reality.
- Her abilities interact chaotically with failing infrastructure: broken pipes become living conduits, collapsed walls reform as organic barriers, dead electronics pulse with empathic awareness.
- Jhace attempts to stabilize her resonance but finds his own abilities affected by proximityâ€”feedback loops threaten both their control.
- Other resistance members experience temporary ability amplification in her presence, suggesting her cascade could trigger widespread awakening among normal humans.
- Reality distortions expand beyond the facility, creating zones where physical laws become negotiable and time flows unpredictably.
- Kira begins manifesting multiple personality aspects corresponding to different resonance principlesâ€”Form-Kira speaks in mathematical equations, Wholeness-Kira feels everyone's pain simultaneously.
- Her cascade attracts divine attention as energy signatures become impossible to hide or suppressâ€”all four gods converge on the location.
- Exit: Jhace faces impossible choiceâ€”suppress Kira's abilities and risk killing her, or allow the cascade to continue and potentially awaken hundreds of new Catalysts.
