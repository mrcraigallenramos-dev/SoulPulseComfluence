Logline: The Auditor tracks divine evolution and dual Catalyst development while maintaining experimental control parameters.

Beats:
- Divine coordination success creates enhanced manipulation framework through unified pressure application and systematic citizen conversion.
- Dual Catalyst development provides optimal redundancy while multiplying experimental opportunities through partnership dynamics.
- Resistance evolution shows expected adaptation patterns - network growth balanced against divine faction coordination improvements.
- Subject psychological profiles remain within manipulation parameters despite increased pressure and coordination challenges.
- Phase progression indicators suggest acceleration toward critical experimental thresholds requiring enhanced monitoring protocols.
- Exit: Experimental framework maintains optimal balance as manipulation complexity increases toward predetermined revelation points.
