Logline: The Auditor observes divine cooperation and Catalyst multiplication with satisfactionâ€”both developments serve long-term manipulation objectives.

Beats:
- Statistical analysis confirms optimal trajectory: divine coordination increases pressure while Catalyst resistance provides necessary friction for sustained conflict.
- Emergence of second Catalyst creates redundancy in strategic assets while multiplying opportunities for manipulation and control.
- Faction programming vulnerabilities noted and filed for future exploitationâ€”resistance victories must be temporary to maintain hope without achieving success.
- Divine cooperation patterns analyzed for stress points that can be exploited to restore competitive friction when tactically advantageous.
- Convergence Protocol development proceeds within acceptable parametersâ€”timeline flexible based on manipulation requirements.
- Subject T status maintained: publicly deceased, actually archived, revelation scheduled for maximum psychological impact in Series 6.
- Phase Three initialization authorized: escalate conflict intensity while preserving strategic balance between divine authority and human resistance.
