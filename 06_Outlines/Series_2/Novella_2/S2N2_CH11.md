Logline: All four gods manifest simultaneously as Kira's cascade reaches critical massâ€”Jhace must choose between preventing another Fathombreak and preserving human agency.

Beats:
- Divine presence warps local reality as four absolute principles attempt to occupy same spaceâ€”air becomes geometric, empathic, sterile, and entropic simultaneously.
- Each god offers solution to Kira's cascade: Xilcore's geometric containment, Leesa's empathic stabilization, Blemo's purification protocols, Seeri's acceptance of destruction.
- Kira's fragmented consciousness pleads for help while her abilities tear wider rifts in space-timeâ€”glimpses of alternate realities where different choices led to different outcomes.
- Jhace realizes the gods need his cooperation not just for Convergence Protocol but to prevent Kira's cascade from destabilizing cosmic foundations.
- He refuses their offers and instead attempts hybrid solution: using his own abilities to create stable resonance bridge that allows Kira to choose her own path.
- The technique requires channeling aspects of all four divine principles simultaneously while maintaining human perspectiveâ€”risking his own identity dissolution.
- During the process, he experiences brief contact with each god's consciousness and understands their genuine concern for cosmic stability despite their authoritarian methods.
- Kira's abilities stabilize when given choice rather than directionâ€”her cascade resolves into controlled hybrid resonance similar to his own.
- Exit: Gods retreat as immediate crisis passes, but their brief cooperation has demonstrated the potential for future coordination against human resistance.
