Logline: Kira, the hybrid child, experiences uncontrolled resonance cascades that mirror Jhace's original Fathombreakâ€”threatening to trigger another divine awakening event.

Beats:
- Kira's hybrid abilities manifest chaotically: Form structures collapse into Wholeness flows, creating reality distortions that spread beyond her immediate vicinity.
- Medical equipment responds to her emotional state, reshaping itself into impossible configurations while maintaining functionâ€”technology becoming empathic.
- Other patients experience temporary ability boosts when near her, suggesting her resonance can amplify existing magical potential in others.
- Jhace recognizes the pattern from his own awakening but struggles to teach control techniques when his own abilities remain emotionally unstable.
- Divine faction scouts detect her resonance signature and identify her as potential second Catalystâ€”acquisition teams mobilize simultaneously.
- Kira's parents beg Jhace to cure her powers rather than train them, seeing magic as curse rather than gift after witnessing faction recruitment.
- During a particularly severe episode, Kira's abilities create temporary rifts in space-time that reveal glimpses of other realitiesâ€”possible futures or parallel timelines.
- Her cascade triggers resonance feedback in Jhace, threatening to repeat his original Fathombreak on a smaller but still devastating scale.
- Exit: Faction forces converge on the clinic as reality distortions make the location impossible to hide or protect.
