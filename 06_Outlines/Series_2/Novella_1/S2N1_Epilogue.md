Logline: Audit closes on Phase Oneâ€”divine conflict seeded, human pluralism alive, Catalyst unclaimed.

Beats:
- KPI summary: recruitment velocity high; indoctrination depth uneven by design.
- Civilian belief fractures prevent any god's totalizationâ€”acceptable entropy.
- Subject T (public): deceased. Subject T (meta): withheld.
- Proceed to Phase Two; schedule parley failures; safeguard balance nodes.
