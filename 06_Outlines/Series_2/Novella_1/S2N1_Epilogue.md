Logline: The Auditor closes Phase One assessment with divine conflict successfully seeded and subject variables within acceptable ranges.

Beats:
- Phase One metrics confirm optimal progression - divine faction emergence and recruitment velocity exceed baseline projections.
- Subject Jhace maintains required psychological instability while demonstrating kill-avoidance protocols essential for future manipulation utility.
- Divine cooperation patterns analyzed for exploitable stress points when factional unity becomes tactically disadvantageous.
- Civilian resistance movements provide necessary opposition variables while maintaining illusion of possible victory against divine authority.
- Probability streams indicate 67.3% likelihood of Phase Two objectives within acceptable temporal parameters.
- Exit: Manipulation framework advances as cosmic chess game enters calculated escalation phase.
