Logline: All factions close; Jhace realizes his "weakness"â€”refusing to killâ€”is the only constant keeping him human.

Beats:
- Scouts crest ridges under four sigils; townsfolk pray to any banner that will spare their children.
- Jhace rescues a Purity lieutenant and a Decay child in the same minute; neither understands mercy.
- He uses Wholeness to share fear between enemies; they hesitate, seeing themselves in the otherâ€”first stalemate won by empathy.
- A Form sniper takes the shot; Vael knocks him from his roost; old-world skill snipes god-world hubris.
- Jhace and Vael run, not triumphant but intactâ€”sometimes survival is victory.
