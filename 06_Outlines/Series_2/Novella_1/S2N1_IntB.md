Logline: The Auditor monitors divine awakening progress with clinical satisfaction, analyzing chaos metrics for optimal manipulation outcomes.

Beats:
- Statistical analysis confirms divine awakening within acceptable parameters - faction recruitment proceeding optimally.
- Chaos distribution metrics show ideal entropy spread across continental populations for continued experimental control.
- Subject Jhace demonstrates required emotional volatility while maintaining hybrid resonance capabilities essential for future manipulation phases.
- Divine faction conflicts create perfect balance - no single god achieving dominance without neutralizing others first.
- Probability calculations suggest 73.6% chance of desired experimental outcomes if current variables continue within projected ranges.
- Contingency protocols remain active for probability branches where divine cooperation or subject psychological stability exceed planned parameters.
- Exit: Phase transition protocols activated as manipulation framework advances toward next experimental milestone.
