Logline: The Auditor's ledger marks Tiffani erased; the gambit advances behind perfect absence.

Beats:
- Curves align within tolerances; dissent spikes where hope survivesâ€”ideal for iteration.
- Catalyst's kill-avoidance persistsâ€”valuable constraint for future shaping.
- Directive: preserve anonymity; no leaks connecting Auditor to past identities until S6-Finale.
- Next phase queued: Convergence Protocol stress-test.
