Logline: Vael argues for a third path: resist all gods; save as many as possible; weaponize truth rather than awe.

Beats:
- Map table littered with analog pins; batteries die, paper endures.
- Defectors brief indoctrination scripts: geometry replaces names; harmony overwrites choice; purity deletes variance; decay romanticizes endings.
- Vael posits: "If they are principles, not villains, then balanceâ€”messy, human, pluralâ€”must be our banner."
- Jhace listens; for once, someone asks nothing from his power but his consent.
- Op-order: expose a Form conversion hub and extract prisonersâ€”prove to civilians that gods lie by omission.
