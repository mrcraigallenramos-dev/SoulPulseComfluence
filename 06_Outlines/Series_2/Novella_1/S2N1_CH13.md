Logline: At an ancient nexus, all four gods posture; Jhace refuses every throneâ€”and chooses balance over victory.

Beats:
- Gate-pillars sing in four keys; air warps under doctrine weight.
- Offers fall like crowns: Order, Peace, Cleanliness, Restâ€”each glorious, each total.
- Jhace threads a hybrid counterpoint; none can hold him without breaking themselves.
- He anchors the pillars in mutual checkâ€”friction locked, collapse avertedâ€”for now.
- The gods retreat nursing pride; mortals cheer a reprieve, not an ending.
