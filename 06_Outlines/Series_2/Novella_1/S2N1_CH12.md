Logline: Seeri blesses failure and fracture; she chooses to protect the Catalystâ€”not to save him, but to ensure the argument continues.

Beats:
- Spores drift like incense; congregants weep from relief at permission to break.
- Seeri kisses rusted steel and it flowers; beauty in ruin, not as metaphor but axiom.
- She names the siblings' plans coffinsâ€”polished, padded, final.
- "Guard the knot," she tells her quiet blades. "He is friction made flesh."
- Her agent takes a path that will place a shield where Jhace will never see it.
