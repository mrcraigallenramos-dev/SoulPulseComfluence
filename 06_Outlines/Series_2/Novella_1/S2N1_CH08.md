Logline: Leesa tests her perfect peace upon unwilling minds and finds the Catalyst's grief resists dissolution.

Beats:
- A thousand voices braid into oneâ€”no loneliness, no edge; creativity quietly dies.
- Leesa models Jhace's psyche; his grief is a knot her harmony cannot untie without killing him.
- She orders gentler nets; acolytes push harder anyway, craving applause.
- The lattice fractures under a memory: Tiffani laughing with windblown hairâ€”pain as shield.
- Leesa pauses, for the first time considering that uniform peace may be a beautiful coffin.
