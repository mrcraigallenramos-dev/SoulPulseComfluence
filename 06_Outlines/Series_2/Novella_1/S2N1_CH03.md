Logline: Hiding among refugees, Jhace heals discreetlyâ€”but every careful act risks exposing him to faction hunters drawn by his hybrid resonance.

Beats:
- Form splints realign bone; Wholeness eases shock; patients whisper "mercy mage."
- Raiders wield raw Decay to conscript teens; Jhace's microburst repels them, collapsing three tentsâ€”saviors bleed too.
- Gratitude curdles into worship; hands grasp his cloak; his shame drags like an anchor.
- Night terror: Tiffani smiling, then light; he wakes mid-equation, mouth tasting ash.
- Vael's trail dogs him; he slips away before her silhouette crosses torchlight.
