# Refugee’s Haven

**Logline:** Hiding among refugees, Jhace discreetly heals the wounded, risking exposure to faction hunters drawn by his resonance.

## Story Bible Alignment
- **Magic:** Wholeness Knot & Form splints under pressure.
- **Romance:** Jhace clings to hope of Tiffani’s return.
- **World:** Refugees worship him as “mercy mage.”
- **Tether IDs:** Emotional tides bind him to every life he saves.

## Beat Breakdown
- Jhace uses Form splints to realign broken bones, Wholeness to soothe shock.
- Raiders wield Decay to conscript teens; Jhace’s microburst collapses tents.
- Gratitude curdles to worship; hands clutch his cloak—binding him to their fate.
- Night terror: Tiffani’s smile fades to ash; he wakes mid-panic, breath tasting dust.
- Vael’s silhouette looms on camp edge; Jhace slips away before recognition.
