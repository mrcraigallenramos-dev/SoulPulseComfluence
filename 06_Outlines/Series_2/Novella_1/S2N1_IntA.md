Logline: Leesa counts the cost of peace and finds a bruise she cannot press flat.

Beats:
- Communes hum; art dims; arguments vanish; children smile the same smile.
- She models futures with zero painâ€”and zero surprise.
- A single grief note persists in her calculus: the Catalyst's refusal as necessary dissonance.
- She pauses her netâ€”an immortal's first restraint.
