Logline: Vael briefs a crumbling state: global magic, divine recruitment, and a single catalystâ€”Jhaceâ€”whose capture could decide civilization's fate.

Beats:
- Holo-grid: 40% manifest minor resonance, 8% combat-tier, 0.1% god-tier across the continent.
- Four power centers rise: Xilcore's Form Consortium (industry), Leesa's Harmony Collective (agriculture), Blemo's Purity Order (labs), Seeri's Decay Cults (ruins).
- Debug-Vault forensics: Tiffani's signature ceases at ground zero; death assumed; Vael flags anomaly privately.
- Enforcement hemorrhages personnel to factions; remaining command debates martial law, triage corridors, or capitulation.
- Vael proposes a scalpel approach: find Jhace and map the blast mechanics; council grants provisional authority and six agents.
- Departure into a world where beat cops face demi-gods with batons and grit.
