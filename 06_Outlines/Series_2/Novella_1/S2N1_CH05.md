Logline: Alone with his grief, Jhace practices control; hunters arriveâ€”divine and humanâ€”and his restraint becomes a weapon.

Beats:
- He shapes rain into lattices, breathes calm into a wounded foxâ€”then drains it by mistake; hands shake.
- Seeri cultists arrive calling him Unmaker, offering worship that tastes like ash.
- He refuses; their prayers turn to knivesâ€”he answers with nonlethal force that fractures rock.
- Form-Consortium skirmishers net him in resonance dampeners tuned to geometry; his Wholeness slips throughâ€”net snaps like thread.
- Vael's team crests the ridge; he flees between hammers, refusing all masters.
