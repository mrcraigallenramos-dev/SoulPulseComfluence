Logline: Xilcore fully awakens in his mortal vessel; geometry takes flesh as he founds an empire to impose perfect order upon a broken world.

Beats:
- Divine memory floods: the first star forged by will; laws etched into void; prison centuries counted by primes.
- His eyes resolve to fractal iris; buildings around him self-correct into perfect symmetries; workers kneel in terror.
- He tastes his siblings: Leesa's blanket-hush, Blemo's antiseptic glare, Seeri's sweet rotâ€”old arguments return clothed in meat.
- Network bootstraps: recruitment cells, geometric catechisms, sanctified factories pulsing like hearts.
- One mortal rings outâ€”a hybrid tone cutting across harmonics: Jhace. Asset or anathema.
- Order issued: acquire the Catalyst intact; adjust probabilities if necessary.
