Logline: Form strikes to capture; Harmony "rescues" to subsume; Purity arrives to sterilize. Jhace must save civilians while refusing all leashes.

Beats:
- He hears their doctrines before he sees them: math, lullaby, scalpel.
- Civilians trapped on spillway; Form hardens water to bars; Harmony soothes them toward surrender; Purity airs sterilant canisters.
- Jhace flips vectorsâ€”softens bars, breaks lullaby with raw grief, redirects sterile mist into empty sluice.
- He refuses killshots; saves lives instead of winning ground; that choice buys him enemies and believers.
- Vael's shot disables Purity captain; she covers Jhace's exit with smoke and old-fashioned courage.
