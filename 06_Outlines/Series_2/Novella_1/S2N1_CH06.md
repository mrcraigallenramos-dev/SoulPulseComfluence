Logline: Following overlapping faction footprints, Vael confirms all four gods hunt the same prize and will burn cities to get him.

Beats:
- She reads ash like Braille: Form's crystalline cut, Harmony's pressure-wave calm, Purity's sterile scorch, Decay's hungry bloom.
- Locals describe "angel wars" fought in perfect uniforms and smiling masks.
- Vael's analysts model pursuit conesâ€”every vector converges toward Jhace's last predicted path.
- She radios Command: recommend civilian evacuation corridors; is denied due to resource collapse.
- Decision: she will shadow Jhace and intercept first, or die in the attempt.
