Logline: Blemo calibrates a continent-wide purge to excise "impure manifestations," with Jhace's hybrid resonance flagged as Patient Zero.

Beats:
- Air hums with surgical hymns; petitions for sterilization signed in silver ink.
- Blemo charts impurity gradients; the Catalyst's waveform corrupts every model of separable principles.
- "Mercy is contamination," he intones; clinicians nod, relieved to outsource guilt to godhood.
- Orders: test-cleansings in ten cities; survivorship is proof of worth, not grace.
- A junior researcher hides shaking handsâ€”keeps a list of names to remember the human cost.
