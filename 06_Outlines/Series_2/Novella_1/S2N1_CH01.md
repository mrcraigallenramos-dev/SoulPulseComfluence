Logline: Jhace awakens alone in the Debug-Vault wreckage; his catastrophic outburst has awakened four gods and granted combat magic to everyoneâ€”while Tiffani is presumed obliterated.

Beats:
- Jhace crawls from smoldering rubble, crystalline ash fused into his skin; resonance pulses like broken glass in his blood.
- In the streets, citizens levitate scrap, weld steel with bare hands, and rupture air with uncontrolled blastsâ€”wonder curdles to terror.
- A baker vaporizes a customer with an untrained Confluence Cannon; grief and awe ripple through onlookers.
- Recruiters with glowing crystalline tattoos sweep blocks: Form (geometry), Harmony (empathy), Purity (sterility), Decay (entropy).
- Jhace finds a glassed crater where Tiffani stood; nothing remainsâ€”guilt detonates a feedback surge he barely cages.
- Consortium agents recognize his resonance and offer command; he runs, vowing never to unleash full power again.
