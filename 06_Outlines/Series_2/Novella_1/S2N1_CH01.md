# Dawn After Storm

**Logline:** Jhace awakens alone in the Debug-Vault wreckage; Tiffani is presumed dead and combat magic is erupting across Grindheim.

## Story Bible Alignment
- **Magic:** Combat Resonance just unleashed—raw, uncontrolled Confluence pulses.
- **Romance:** Jhace grieves Tiffani’s loss but feels an inexplicable pull to survive.
- **World:** Four god-factions recruiting from the rubble.
- **Character:** Jhace as lone survivor, haunted by betrayal and duty.

## Beat Breakdown
- Jhace crawls from smoldering debris, ash fused to his skin, resonance crackling in his veins.
- Streets filled with untrained resonants: scrap flies, beams rip flesh, wonder turns to terror.
- A baker’s first Confluence Cannon vaporizes a bystander—shock ripples through the city.
- Four recruiters appear with glowing tattoos: Form, Wholeness, Purity, Decay manifest.
- Jhace finds only a scorched crater where Tiffani stood; guilt detonates a feedback surge he barely contains.
- Consortium agents identify his hybrid signature; he flees, vowing never to wield full power again.
