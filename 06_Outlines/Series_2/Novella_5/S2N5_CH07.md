Logline: Leesa detects approaching emotional catastrophe through empathic projectionâ€”cosmic manipulation building toward psychological devastation that will shatter reformed society.

Beats:
- Empathic monitoring reveals subtle emotional currents suggesting impending traumatic revelation: anxiety patterns indicating unconscious preparation for betrayal discovery.
- Population psychology shows strong investment in reformed society and authentic relationships: emotional vulnerability to systematic deception exposure.
- Leesa's divine nature demands protecting citizens from psychological devastation while recognizing cosmic manipulation beyond her individual power to prevent.
- Empathic projection into probability streams shows alternative futures: revelation scenarios resulting in social collapse, individual psychological destruction, loss of cooperative governance.
- Communication with siblings reveals universal recognition of approaching crisis: cosmic forces preparing final manipulation phase despite divine opposition.
- Strategic planning for psychological support systems: preparing emotional stabilization resources for anticipated revelation trauma.
- Divine decision to prioritize citizen welfare over cosmic balance: accepting potential universal instability to protect human psychological health.
- Preparation of empathic intervention protocols designed to cushion anticipated emotional devastation while maintaining authentic choice and individual agency.
