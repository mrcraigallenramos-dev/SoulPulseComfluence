Logline: Vael's investigation into Tiffani's disappearance reveals evidence of cosmic-scale manipulation orchestrating events from the original awakening through current liberation.

Beats:
- Research facility equipped with pre-awakening analysis technology reveals pattern of probability manipulation spanning years of apparent random events.
- Tiffani investigation yields conclusive evidence: survival confirmed through energy signature analysis and timeline reconstruction of Debug Vault incident.
- Analysis reveals systematic orchestration: awakening timing, faction development, integration success, and liberation revelation following predetermined sequence.
- Cross-referencing historical data shows similar patterns in past civilizations: awakening events, divine emergence, social transformation, and mysterious guidance.
- Discovery of Counter-Spark influence operating through probability manipulation rather than direct intervention: cosmic chess game using mortals as pieces.
- Intelligence network reveals agents operating with knowledge of orchestrated events: individuals positioned to influence outcomes while maintaining facade of authentic choice.
- Vael realizes her own investigation was guided through selective information availability and convenient access to classified materials.
- Strategic assessment shows liberation success serves larger manipulation agenda: restored individual agency creating conditions for maximum psychological impact.
