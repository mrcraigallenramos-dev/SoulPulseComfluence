Logline: Vael coordinates network-wide preparation for cosmic revelation while maintaining operational security against forces that orchestrated their discovery.

Beats:
- Network coordination reveals universal preparation: reformed society unconsciously organizing defensive systems against anticipated psychological attack.
- Intelligence sharing confirms cosmic manipulation timeline: revelation scheduled to coincide with maximum emotional investment in current relationships and achievements.
- Strategic planning for revelation aftermath: information distribution systems, psychological support networks, alternative governance structures if current systems collapse.
- Vael's personal preparation for Tiffani revelation: accepting that their relationship and its impact served cosmic manipulation agenda beyond personal authentic connection.
- Coordination with divine advisors reveals universal preparation: gods developing support systems while accepting limitation of their protective capabilities.
- Network decision to maintain operational security while sharing essential information: preparing defenses without alerting cosmic manipulators to awareness level.
- Recognition that defensive preparation itself may serve manipulation agenda: allowed awareness creating false sense of control over cosmic forces.
- Strategic commitment to network survival regardless of revelation outcome: preserving human agency and cooperative capability through anticipated psychological devastation.
