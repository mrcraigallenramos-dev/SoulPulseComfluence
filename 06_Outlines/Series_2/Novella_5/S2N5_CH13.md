Logline: Cosmic forces align for ultimate revelation as reformed society demonstrates unprecedented unity and preparation for the truth that will test every relationship and belief.

Beats:
- Continental preparation reveals universal readiness: citizens, reformed factions, divine advisors, and resistance networks coordinating for anticipated crisis.
- Reality distortions begin as cosmic manipulation reaches culmination: probability streams converging toward predetermined revelation moment.
- Network coordination confirms readiness: psychological support systems, alternative governance structures, and authentic relationship affirmations in place.
- Divine advisory council provides final guidance while acknowledging limitation of their protective capabilities against cosmic-scale psychological attack.
- Catalyst coordination demonstrates hybrid abilities at full power: Form and Wholeness combining to create unprecedented defensive and healing capabilities.
- Population psychology shows remarkable resilience: reformed society's authentic choice foundation providing strength for confronting systematic deception.
- Moment of cosmic silence as manipulation forces prepare final revelation: universe holding breath before truth exposure that will transform everything.
- Unity demonstration as reformed society faces unknown together: authentic cooperation transcending orchestrated development and systematic manipulation.
- Exit: Reality fractures as cosmic revelation beginsâ€”the truth about Tiffani, manipulation, and foundational deception emerges to test every bond.
