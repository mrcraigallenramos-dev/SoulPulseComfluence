Logline: Six months after the awakening, Jhace works in reformed faction systems that preserve benefits while respecting individual choiceâ€”but deeper questions about cosmic manipulation remain unanswered.

Beats:
- Medical center operates with balanced efficiency: mathematical optimization serving human needs rather than abstract perfection, patient choice prioritized over systemic convenience.
- Jhace's restored abilities allow detection of authentic emotional health versus therapeutic suppression, but some citizens struggle with unlimited choice after years of guidance.
- Reformed faction cooperation creates unprecedented prosperity: divine expertise serving human agency rather than replacing it with systematic control.
- Patient consultations reveal ongoing psychological adjustment: some citizens prefer structured guidance while others embrace full autonomy, requiring individualized approaches.
- Jhace notices subtle patterns suggesting deeper manipulation: coincidental events, convenient timing, underlying orchestration beyond divine faction planning.
- Investigation into cosmic balance reveals concerning data: universal stability requires ongoing friction between order and chaos, creation and destruction.
- Personal reflection on his journey from awakening to integration to liberation raises questions about authentic choice versus sophisticated manipulation.
- Communication with Kira reveals shared concerns about forces operating beyond divine awareness, suggesting manipulation at cosmic rather than terrestrial level.
