Logline: Blemo develops protocols for managing revelation trauma while recognizing that cosmic manipulation exposure will challenge his understanding of purity and authentic truth.

Beats:
- Research into psychological trauma reveals revelation scenarios that could shatter individual and social psychology beyond repair or recovery.
- Blemo's nature demands eliminating deception and establishing pure truth, but cosmic manipulation complexity challenges concepts of absolute authenticity.
- Protocol development for managing systematic deception exposure: graduated revelation procedures, identity reconstruction support, authentic choice validation systems.
- Recognition that his own divine nature and cooperation may be products of cosmic manipulation rather than authentic transformation and growth.
- Medical preparation for population-wide identity crisis: resources for rebuilding sense of self and authentic relationships after systematic deception exposure.
- Coordination with reformed faction systems to maintain essential services during anticipated social and psychological upheaval.
- Divine consultation reveals universal uncertainty: gods themselves questioning authenticity of their own development and decision-making processes.
- Strategic decision to provide support regardless of personal authenticity questions: maintaining service commitment transcending cosmic manipulation concerns.
