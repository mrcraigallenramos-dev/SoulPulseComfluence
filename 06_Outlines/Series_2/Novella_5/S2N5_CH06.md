Logline: Vael discovers historical records revealing cyclical pattern of cosmic manipulation across multiple civilizations and timelines.

Beats:
- Archive analysis reveals similar awakening events throughout history: divine emergence, social transformation, apparent liberation, followed by systematic destruction.
- Pattern recognition shows consistent manipulation methodology: probability adjustment, orchestrated crises, guided development toward predetermined psychological devastation.
- Historical records document previous Catalysts: individuals with hybrid abilities appearing during cosmic transitions, always serving unknowing roles in larger manipulation.
- Cross-civilization comparison reveals identical progression: awakening, conflict, integration, reformation, followed by revelation that destroys psychological foundations.
- Discovery of Counter-Spark involvement across multiple timelines: systematic psychological experimentation using entire civilizations as test subjects.
- Analysis of Tiffani case reveals connection to historical pattern: similar disappearances and manipulated returns designed for maximum emotional impact.
- Recognition that current investigation was anticipated and guided: allowed discovery serving manipulation agenda by creating false sense of understanding and control.
- Strategic decision to share findings while preparing defensive measures against anticipated cosmic-scale revelation and psychological attack.
