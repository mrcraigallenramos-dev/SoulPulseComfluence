Logline: Leesa monitors resistance psychological states and recognizes their suffering as genuineâ€”her empathic nature conflicts with strategic necessity of eliminating opposition.

Beats:
- Monitoring systems track emotional states across continental population, revealing resistance members experiencing authentic anguish over ideological collapse.
- Empathic analysis shows resistance fighters genuinely believe their opposition serves moral purpose despite contrary evidence.
- Leesa experiences their psychological pain directly through divine consciousness, feeling their confusion, grief, and desperate need for meaningful purpose.
- Her nature demands alleviating all suffering, but resistance elimination requires accepting their temporary distress for greater long-term harmony.
- Internal divine conflict: absolute empathy versus strategic necessity, immediate compassion versus ultimate peace.
- Consultation with siblings reveals similar strugglesâ€”each god confronting contradictions between divine nature and tactical requirements.
- Leesa proposes modified approach: therapeutic conversion that validates resistance members' moral concerns while integrating them into faction systems.
- Strategic compromise allows resistance to maintain opposition identity while channeling their energy toward constructive criticism within faction framework.
- Exit: Orders issued for compassionate conversionâ€”heal resistance suffering while preserving their valuable perspective within improved society.
