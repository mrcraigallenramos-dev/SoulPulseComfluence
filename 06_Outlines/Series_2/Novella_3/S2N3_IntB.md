Logline: The Auditor monitors integration success while preparing systematic pressure protocols designed to test conversion stability.

Beats:
- Integration efficiency metrics exceed projections - voluntary conversion rates optimal for sustained manipulation framework maintenance.
- Subject psychological adaptation tracked through compliance indicators and authentic choice preservation within acceptable manipulation parameters.
- Divine faction evolution shows stable cooperation emergence while maintaining competitive elements essential for continued experimental utility.
- Resistance dissolution provides integration success validation while eliminating systematic opposition to experimental framework progression.
- Conversion stability analysis suggests enhanced manipulation opportunities through apparent choice preservation and voluntary cooperation frameworks.
- Strategic assessment indicates readiness for enhanced pressure protocols testing integration resilience and manipulation framework durability.
- Exit: Phase advancement authorized as integration success creates optimal conditions for systematic pressure application and manipulation testing.
