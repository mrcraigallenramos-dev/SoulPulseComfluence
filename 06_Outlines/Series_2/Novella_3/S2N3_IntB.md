Logline: Seeri contemplates the resistance's approaching end and recognizes it as necessary evolutionâ€”their opposition served its cosmic function and now must transform.

Beats:
- Meditation among organic decay reveals universal truth: all opposition eventually transforms or dies, serving cosmic balance through necessary friction.
- Strategic analysis confirms resistance has achieved its purposeâ€”forcing faction evolution toward genuine improvement rather than simple control.
- Seeri recognizes pattern: Catalysts and resistance emerged to challenge divine authority, ensuring gods serve cosmic balance rather than personal power.
- Her siblings have learned compassion through opposition, developing wisdom that pure authority never could have achieved.
- Divine contemplation reveals next phase: resistance transformation into constructive criticism within integrated society rather than external opposition.
- Seeri accepts responsibility for ending what she helped preserveâ€”resistance served its function and continued existence now impedes universal health.
- Orders issued to followers: allow resistance to choose honorable integration rather than forcing destructive final conflict.
- Exit: Cosmic cycle completes as opposition transforms into cooperation, friction evolves into harmony, and balance advances to new equilibrium.
