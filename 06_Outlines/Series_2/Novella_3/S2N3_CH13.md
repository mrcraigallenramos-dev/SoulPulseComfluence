Logline: Both Catalysts choose integration over opposition, but their conversion includes unique roles as constructive critics within faction society.

Beats:
- Integration ceremony celebrates transformation rather than surrender: resistance values preserved while destructive opposition ends.
- Jhace's conversion addresses trauma-driven behavior while maintaining commitment to medical ethics and patient welfare within improved systems.
- Kira's integration expands empathic abilities while providing community and purpose previously unavailable through resistance isolation.
- Both Catalysts retain hybrid abilities but channel power toward construction rather than oppositionâ€”healing rather than liberation.
- Conversion process validates resistance concerns: faction integration includes mechanisms for internal criticism and continued improvement.
- New roles defined: Catalysts serve as advocates for individual agency within collective systems, ensuring balance between harmony and autonomy.
- Resistance network dissolves as members choose integration or neutral zone lifeâ€”opposition ends through voluntary transformation rather than defeat.
- Faction coordination evolves to include former resistance perspectives, creating more balanced and responsive governance systems.
- Continental integration completes with former enemies serving constructive roles within improved society.
- Exit: Both Catalysts find meaning and community within faction systems while maintaining commitment to principles that motivated their original resistance.
