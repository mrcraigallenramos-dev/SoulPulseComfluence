Logline: Blemo analyzes resistance psychology and concludes their opposition stems from attachment to dysfunctionâ€”their elimination becomes medical necessity.

Beats:
- Research data confirms faction territories demonstrate superior outcomes across all metrics: health, happiness, productivity, social stability.
- Psychological profiles of resistance members reveal common patterns: trauma attachment, authority rejection, nostalgia for chaos and dysfunction.
- Blemo diagnoses resistance as pathological condition: inability to accept improvement due to identity investment in struggle and suffering.
- Clinical protocols developed for resistance "treatment": gentle conversion techniques that preserve personality while eliminating oppositional pathology.
- Strategic assessment concludes Catalysts represent patient zero of resistance pathologyâ€”their cure would eliminate movement's psychological foundation.
- Divine consultation reveals sibling agreement: resistance serves no cosmic function and impedes universal optimization for purely emotional reasons.
- Treatment authorization approved: systematic conversion of resistance members through compassionate but comprehensive psychological intervention.
- Exit: Medical teams deployed with orders to cure resistance pathology through voluntary acceptance of necessary improvement.
