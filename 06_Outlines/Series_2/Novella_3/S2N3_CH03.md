Logline: Kira interviews recently liberated converts and discovers faction programming has evolved beyond simple mind control to genuine psychological transformation.

Beats:
- Interview chamber equipped with resonance dampeners and empathic monitors to detect deception, coercion, or residual programming.
- Former Form Consortium engineer describes mathematical aesthetics as genuinely beautiful rather than imposedâ€”geometric order bringing authentic joy.
- Harmony Collective refugee insists shared consciousness felt like belonging rather than loss, empathic connection providing meaning and purpose.
- Purity Order medical researcher explains clean living as liberation from biological limitations rather than sterile restriction.
- Decay Cultist artist celebrates entropy as creative force rather than destructive obsession, finding beauty in transformation and impermanence.
- Kira's empathic abilities detect genuine emotions rather than programmed responsesâ€”converts truly believe faction life provides superior existence.
- Some converts request return to faction territories, viewing liberation as traumatic separation from meaningful community and personal identity.
- Psychological analysis reveals faction conversion creates authentic personality changes that persist even after programming removal.
- Exit: Kira questions whether liberation network fights for freedom or imposes its own ideology of individualism against genuine collective happiness.
