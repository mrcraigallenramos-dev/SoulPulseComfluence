Logline: Kira accepts faction invitation for voluntary observation tour, experiencing their territories firsthand to evaluate resistance claims against direct evidence.

Beats:
- Tour begins in Form Consortium city where mathematical optimization creates genuine beauty: architecture that pleases eye while maximizing function.
- Citizens demonstrate satisfaction with geometric living: work provides meaning, relationships follow optimal patterns, creativity flows within structured parameters.
- Harmony Collective commune shows emotional health: conflicts resolved through empathy, decisions made collectively, individual needs balanced against community welfare.
- Purity Order enclave eliminates suffering through medical intervention: no disease, no addiction, no mental illness, inhabitants free to pursue personal development.
- Decay Cult territory embraces change: artistic innovation, acceptance of endings, transformation celebrated rather than feared.
- Kira's empathic abilities confirm citizen happiness as authentic rather than programmedâ€”faction membership provides genuine improvement over neutral zone life.
- Personal conversations reveal citizens who chose faction membership after careful consideration, finding their decisions validated by experience.
- Tour concludes with invitation to remain temporarily, experiencing faction life without commitment while resistance network waits for her report.
- Exit: Kira faces decision that will define her relationship with resistance movementâ€”honest reporting might destroy ideological foundation of opposition.
