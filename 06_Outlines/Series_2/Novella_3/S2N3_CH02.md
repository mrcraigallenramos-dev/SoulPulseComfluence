Logline: Vael leads reconnaissance into faction territories that now appear genuinely utopianâ€”questioning whether resistance fights tyranny or prevents legitimate social evolution.

Beats:
- Form Consortium cities display mathematical perfection: optimized traffic flow, zero waste, perfect resource allocation, inhabitants working with satisfied efficiency.
- Harmony Collective communes show genuine peace: conflict resolution through empathy, shared decision-making, emotional support for all members.
- Purity Order enclaves eliminate suffering: no disease, no addiction, no mental illness, inhabitants living in clean contentment.
- Decay Cult territories embrace change: artistic innovation, acceptance of death and renewal, beauty emerging from breakdown and transformation.
- Citizens in all territories appear genuinely happy rather than coercively controlledâ€”their satisfaction complicates resistance moral framework.
- Vael questions whether her opposition stems from principled commitment to freedom or nostalgic attachment to dysfunction and chaos.
- Intelligence gathering reveals trade and cooperation between territoriesâ€”faction coordination creating continental stability and prosperity.
- Local resistance cells report difficulty recruiting as civilians compare faction territories favorably to neutral zones plagued by conflict and scarcity.
