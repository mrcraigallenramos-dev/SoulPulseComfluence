Logline: Jhace treats resistance fighters breaking down under psychological pressure while facing his own choiceâ€”continue futile opposition or accept therapeutic conversion.

Beats:
- Crisis center overwhelmed with resistance members experiencing mental collapse as their worldview crumbles under faction success.
- Treatment options limited: medication provides temporary relief, but underlying ideological conflict continues causing psychological damage.
- Faction medical teams offer comprehensive treatment: therapeutic conversion that resolves cognitive dissonance while preserving individual identity.
- Jhace's patients plead for faction treatment, viewing conversion as healing rather than surrenderâ€”their suffering demands professional response.
- Personal crisis deepens as he recognizes similar symptoms in himself: obsessive opposition, trauma-driven decision making, inability to accept improvement.
- Faction therapeutics specialists explain conversion process: gentle integration that validates resistance concerns while providing constructive outlet within improved society.
- Medical ethics require addressing patient suffering through most effective treatment available, regardless of personal political opposition.
- Self-examination reveals his resistance may cause more harm than goodâ€”patients suffer for his ideological commitments rather than their genuine welfare.
- Exit: Jhace authorizes faction treatment for willing patients while scheduling personal consultation to address his own psychological needs.
