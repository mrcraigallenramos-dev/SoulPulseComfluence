Logline: Kira undergoes faction conversion consultation, exploring how her abilities could serve integrated society while maintaining personal autonomy and moral principles.

Beats:
- Consultation chamber designed for comfort and openness: no coercion or pressure, only patient exploration of options and possibilities.
- Faction representatives acknowledge her concerns about freedom and individual choice while demonstrating how conversion preserves core identity.
- Hybrid abilities analysis reveals her power could accelerate societal improvement: healing trauma, facilitating cooperation, optimizing social systems.
- Conversion process explained as expansion rather than limitation: enhanced capabilities, broader perspective, connection to greater purpose.
- Personal history review shows faction membership would address her isolation and provide meaningful community without eliminating individual agency.
- Therapeutic integration would heal psychological wounds from awakening trauma while preserving valuable resistance perspective.
- Kira realizes conversion offers everything she genuinely wants: purpose, community, personal growth, ability to help others effectively.
- Resistance to integration stems from loyalty to Jhace and abstract principle rather than practical concern about personal welfare or authentic choice.
- Exit: Kira accepts conversion consultation while maintaining connection to resistance networkâ€”testing integration while preserving option to withdraw.
