Logline: Two years after the Fathombreak, Jhace leads a network of liberation teams, but success in freeing converts has prompted divine factions to develop more sophisticated control mechanisms.

Beats:
- Liberation headquarters built in abandoned underground transit system, expanded with hybrid resonance architecture that adapts to occupant needs.
- Status briefings show mixed results: hundreds of converts successfully liberated, but faction programming techniques evolving faster than countermeasures.
- New faction converts show deeper integration: memories altered rather than suppressed, personality modifications that make them genuinely prefer servitude.
- Kira, now experienced in liberation techniques, reports increasing difficulty distinguishing authentic faction loyalty from coercive programming.
- Intelligence reveals factions developing "willing conversion" protocols that make subjects believe they chose faction membership freely.
- Jhace struggles with ethical implications of forced liberationâ€”some converts fight violently to return to factions, believing rescue is kidnapping.
- Strategic planning complicated by moral questions: when does liberation become another form of coercion, and who decides what constitutes authentic choice?
- Recent operations show factions learning to use liberated converts as double agents, feeding false intelligence while appearing genuinely rescued.
