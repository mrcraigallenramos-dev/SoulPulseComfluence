Logline: Jhace treats resistance members suffering psychological trauma from witnessing faction successâ€”their commitment to opposition causes genuine mental illness.

Beats:
- Medical facility treating resistance fighters experiencing depression, anxiety, and identity crisis as their worldview collapses under contrary evidence.
- Patients describe symptoms: nightmares about faction territories, guilt over opposing genuine improvement, fear that their resistance serves selfish rather than principled motives.
- Jhace's hybrid abilities detect authentic psychological distress rather than external manipulationâ€”resistance members genuinely suffering from cognitive dissonance.
- Treatment requires confronting uncomfortable truths: factions may represent legitimate social evolution rather than tyrannical control systems.
- Some patients request discharge to join factions, viewing conversion as treatment for psychological conflict rather than surrender to enemy.
- Jhace struggles with professional ethics: healing requires addressing causes of distress, but faction membership might genuinely solve patients' problems.
- Medical consultations reveal his own symptoms: persistent grief over Tiffani, guilt over awakening gods, obsessive need to oppose authority regardless of merit.
- Self-examination forces recognition that his resistance may stem from personal trauma rather than rational analysis of faction impact.
- Exit: Jhace continues treatment but questions whether his opposition serves patients' welfare or perpetuates their psychological suffering.
