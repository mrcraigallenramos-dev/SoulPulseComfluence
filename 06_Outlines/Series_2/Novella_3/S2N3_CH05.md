Logline: Faction conversion teams arrive in neutral zones offering voluntary improvement rather than demanding submissionâ€”psychological pressure replacing military force.

Beats:
- Conversion teams present detailed proposals for community improvement: infrastructure optimization, health enhancement, social harmony protocols.
- Citizens receive individual consultations exploring their specific dissatisfactions and how faction membership could address personal problems.
- No threats or coercionâ€”only patient explanation of benefits and invitation to experience faction life temporarily before making permanent decision.
- Medical teams offer free treatment for chronic conditions using faction technology unavailable in neutral zones.
- Educational programs demonstrate faction achievements: artistic masterpieces, scientific breakthroughs, social innovations impossible under current systems.
- Vael watches community members genuinely tempted by offers that address real needs and provide authentic improvements to daily life.
- Resistance arguments against conversion sound increasingly hollow when faction representatives acknowledge criticism and offer reasonable solutions.
- Community leaders begin accepting faction consultation on governance, allowing gradual integration rather than demanding immediate conversion.
- Exit: Vael realizes military resistance has become obsoleteâ€”factions have learned to win through genuine appeal rather than force.
