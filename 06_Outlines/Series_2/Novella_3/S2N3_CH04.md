Logline: Jhace and Kira confront the philosophical crisis threatening their movementâ€”whether continued resistance serves freedom or merely opposes successful social evolution.

Beats:
- Council meeting includes liberated converts, resistance veterans, and neutral zone civilians debating fundamental questions about freedom versus happiness.
- Statistical analysis shows faction territories achieving measurable improvements in health, productivity, artistic achievement, and citizen satisfaction.
- Resistance recruitment declining as potential members choose faction membership over joining liberation networkâ€”voluntary conversion increasing.
- Strategic assessment reveals faction coordination creating continental prosperity while neutral zones suffer resource scarcity and increasing instability.
- Jhace argues for continuation based on principle: freedom to choose includes right to make harmful decisions, and coercive utopia remains tyranny.
- Kira presents counterargument: their hybrid abilities originated from divine awakening, making them tools of cosmic forces rather than purely human agents.
- Council members debate whether their resistance serves human agency or represents unconscious manipulation by Counter-Spark forces opposing divine harmony.
- Vote narrowly supports continued operations but splits networkâ€”some members defect to factions, others establish separate neutralist organizations.
- Exit: Both Catalysts committed to resistance but acknowledge their movement may be fighting against genuine human flourishing for abstract principles.
