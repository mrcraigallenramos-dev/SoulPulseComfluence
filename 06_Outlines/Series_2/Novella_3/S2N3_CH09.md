Logline: Mass defections from resistance to factions create operational collapseâ€”Vael must choose between accepting defeat or escalating to desperate measures.

Beats:
- Safe house populations declining as members accept faction conversion offers, viewing membership as personal improvement rather than surrender.
- Intelligence networks compromised as former agents provide faction forces with resistance location and operational details.
- Supply lines disrupted as neutral zone supporters join factions, cutting off resource flow and logistical support.
- Leadership council fragmenting as commanders debate whether continued resistance serves any constructive purpose.
- Military assessments confirm resistance capability degraded beyond effective operational thresholdâ€”faction conversion has succeeded where force failed.
- Vael's personal crisis: her investigation into Tiffani's death reveals more evidence suggesting survival, but faction membership might provide better life for everyone.
- Strategic options reduced to desperate measures: terrorist attacks on faction infrastructure, assassination of conversion teams, sabotage of improvement projects.
- Final council vote authorizes extreme measures by narrow marginâ€”resistance transition from liberation to destructive opposition.
- Exit: Vael accepts command of terrorist cell while questioning whether her actions serve freedom or perpetuate unnecessary suffering.
