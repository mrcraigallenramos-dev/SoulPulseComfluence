Logline: Xilcore coordinates with his siblings to finalize continental integrationâ€”their cooperation has evolved into genuine partnership rather than competitive alliance.

Beats:
- Coordination center exists in folded space where all four divine domains intersect: geometric order, empathic harmony, sterile purity, beautiful decay.
- Statistical reports confirm 85% population acceptance of faction membership through voluntary conversion rather than coercive recruitment.
- Integration protocols balance competing divine principles: mathematical efficiency with empathic consideration, pure optimization with acceptance of necessary change.
- Each god contributes specialized expertise while subordinating absolute nature to collective benefitâ€”unprecedented cooperation in cosmic history.
- Resistance analysis reveals opposition concentrated among individuals with psychological trauma preventing acceptance of improvement.
- Xilcore proposes compassionate solution: therapeutic conversion that heals trauma while integrating resistant personalities into faction systems.
- Strategic planning addresses Catalyst question: their hybrid abilities remain valuable, but opposition serves no constructive purpose.
- Divine consensus reached: offer Catalysts meaningful roles in integrated society while eliminating their capacity for destructive resistance.
- Exit: Conversion protocols authorizedâ€”systematic healing of resistance pathology through voluntary acceptance of necessary improvement.
