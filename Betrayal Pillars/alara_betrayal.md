## Core Deception
Alara, the loyal ally and moral center, betrays Jhace and Tiffani not out of selfishness but from prophetic conviction.  
Convinced by visions that Jhace and Tiffani will one day destroy the world, she sacrifices her friendship to save 317 children.  

The central irony: the act of mercy that defines her character also becomes the betrayal that breaks their trust.

## Narrative Purpose
- **Moral Ambiguity**: Shows that betrayal can be rooted in compassion, not malice.  
- **Catalyst**: The first deep fracture in the Found Family’s unity.  
- **Foreshadowing**: Introduces the theme that even love and loyalty can become weapons.

## Arc Trajectory
### Build-Up
- Trusted mentor and stabilizing presence in early training.  
- Her visions of catastrophe create mounting tension.  

### Execution
- Invokes the **Mercy Veto**, saving 317 children.  
- In doing so, she places them within Lysandra’s political sphere, allowing their salvation to be co-opted and branded as part of the Copper Crown platform.  
- Betrays Jhace and Tiffani’s trust by making this choice without their consent.  

### Fallout
- Becomes a tragic, liminal figure — despised for her betrayal yet never fully villainized.  
- The copper rosary of 317 heartbeats becomes a haunting symbol of both salvation and treachery.

## Key Symbolism
- **Mercy Veto**: Compassion wielded as a blade.  
- **Copper Rosary**: The heartbeats of the children, her legacy and her burden.
