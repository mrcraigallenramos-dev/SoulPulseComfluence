# Aethelgard / Aethros

Aethelgard, known to its inhabitants as Aethros, is a world born from a cataclysmic "First Spark" and later reshaped by the "God Shock".  
It serves as the setting for The Confluence Chronicles, a world where the very landscape is a living reflection of the saga's themes of conflict, betrayal, and the struggle for balance.  
Its essence is interwoven with the **Soulpulse Confluence**, and its geography is a complex tapestry of competing ideologies and ancient grievances.

## The Seven Kingdoms of the Shattered Realm

The world is divided into seven primary kingdoms, each born from the chaos of the Shattering and representing a distinct facet of Aethelgard's struggle and potential.

* **[[The Golden Dominion]]** (Central Heartland): The economic and spiritual heartland, rich with crystallized Vitaflow deposits.  
* **[[The Stellar Reaches]]** (Northern Wilderness): A cosmic frontier of perpetual cold, where aurora-like Stellar Resonance creates permanent light shows.  
* **[[The Shadow Marches]]** (Eastern Wetlands): A dangerous, reality-bending region where divine seals leaked entropy, creating swamplands where reality becomes fluid.  
* **[[The Iron Republics]]** (Southern Industrial Zone): The industrial powerhouse of Aethelgard, with mountain ranges carved into terraced complexes powered by soul energy.  
* **[[The Healing Gardens]]** (Western Coastal Region): A sanctuary of restorative power, built around natural Vitaflow springs with healing properties.  
* **[[The Twilight Courts]]** (Northwestern Diplomatic Zone): A realm of diplomacy and hidden agendas, composed of floating islands connected by bridges of crystallized negotiation energy.  
* **[[The Wild Resonance]]** (Southeastern Frontier): An ever-changing, chaotic landscape that reshapes itself based on dominant emotions, inhabited by nomadic tribes.  

## The World Spine Network

The world is interconnected by the World Spine, a planetary nervous system composed of Vitaflow convergence points and energy streams.

* **Primary Nodes**: Seven major Vitaflow convergence points, one located in each kingdom.  
* **Secondary Networks**: Hundreds of smaller nodes that create a planetary-wide network.  
* **The Deep Spine**: An underground network that connects all surface nodes.  
* **Resonance Rivers**: Streams of pure Vitaflow that flow between the major nodes.  
* **Null Zones**: Areas where the Spine was damaged, creating regions that are dead to magic.
