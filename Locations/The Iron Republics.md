# The Iron Republics
(Southern Industrial Zone)

The Iron Republics are the industrial powerhouse of Aethelgard, a nation where entire mountain ranges have been carved into terraced industrial complexes. The massive factories and "Great Engines" that dominate the landscape are a visual representation of Calix's cold, calculating logic and the dehumanizing efficiency he champions. The society is technologically advanced, but this progress has come at a great cost, leading to the exploitation of its workers and the pollution of the environment.

## Key Details
* **Capital**: [[Gearwright's Throne]] – A massive factory-city powered by soul energy.  
* **Geography**: Mountain ranges carved into terraced industrial complexes.  
* **Climate**: Artificially controlled through Vitaflow manipulation systems.  
* **Trade Routes**: The Steam Lines – a network of pneumatic transport tubes powered by compressed soul energy.  

## Unique Features & Landmarks
* **[[Foundry Houses]]**: Massive soul-powered manufacturing complexes that form the industrial heart of the Republics.  
* **[[The Great Engines]]**: City-sized machines that convert raw emotion directly into mechanical power.  
* **[[Worker Colonies]]**: Sprawling residential areas designed specifically to maximize the extraction of Vitaflow from the populace. The inherent exploitation within these colonies subtly foreshadows the resource betrayal in Series 4 of the saga.  

## Culture & Society
Life in the Iron Republics is defined by efficiency, order, and industry. The culture is highly structured and disciplined, often at the expense of individual freedom and expression. Fashion is utilitarian and robust, designed for work and safety. Clothing is made from heavy-duty fabrics with reinforced seams and integrated tools, and colors are typically dark to hide the ever-present soot and grime of industrial life.
