# The Shadow Marches
(Eastern Wetlands)

The Shadow Marches are a dangerous and reality-bending region in eastern Aethros, born from divine seals that leaked entropy into the world. The landscape is swamplands where reality itself becomes fluid, with only small islands of stability remaining. The perpetual mist that blankets the region is a metaphor for its pervasive deception and moral ambiguity; it is said to physically reflect the deepest fears and desires of those who view it.

## Key Details
* **Capital**: [[Entropy's Edge]] – A city built precariously on the border between order and chaos.  
* **Geography**: Fluid swamplands with scattered islands of stability.  
* **Climate**: A perpetual, mysterious mist that reflects the viewer's inner state.  
* **Trade Routes**: The Memory Paths – treacherous routes that exist only within the collective consciousness. These paths are said to hold the lingering echoes of past betrayals.  

## Unique Features & Landmarks
* **[[Rot Zones]]**: Areas where divine seals once leaked entropy before being contained. These are the source of the region's instability.  
* **[[Void Sanctuaries]]**: Hidden temples where those known as the "Entropy Touched" practice reality manipulation.  
* **[[The Living Marsh]]**: A unique ecosystem within the swamps that physically responds and reacts to emotional Vitaflow.  

## Culture & Society
The fluid, ever-changing nature of the Shadow Marches has forged a culture that is adaptable, secretive, and comfortable with ambiguity. The people here are masters of illusion and deception, and their society is a labyrinth of hidden meanings and shifting alliances.
