# The Healing Gardens
(Western Coastal Region)

The Healing Gardens are a sanctuary of restoration on the western coast of Aethelgard. The region is a society focused on the restorative and life-giving aspects of Vitaflow, with technology that is organic and symbiotic, designed to work in harmony with nature. The air here is thick with the sweet, earthy scent of Glimmer Moss, mingled with the fresh, clean aroma of medicinal herbs and the faint, metallic tang of Vitaflow.

## Key Details
* **Capital**: [[Brightforge Haven]] – A hospital-city built around natural Vitaflow springs.  
* **Geography**: Terraced coastal cliffs featuring healing hot springs and medicinal forests.  
* **Climate**: Mild and restorative, with weather patterns that are believed to promote emotional healing.  
* **Trade Routes**: The Mercy Roads – pathways that have been blessed to ease the physical and spiritual pain of travelers.  

## Unique Features & Landmarks
* **[[The Great Infirmary]]**: A massive hospital complex capable of treating both the body and the soul.  
* **[[Resonance Springs]]**: Natural geysers of pure Vitaflow that possess potent healing properties. It is believed these springs subtly reflect the emotional state of the world.  
* **[[The Memorial Gardens]]**: Sacred grounds where the Vitaflow of the dead nourishes new life. While a place of healing, these gardens also carry a poignant and grim reminder of the sacrifices made—particularly by [[Tiffani Brightforge]]—and the reality that healing often comes at a terrible cost.
