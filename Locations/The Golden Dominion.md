# The Golden Dominion
(Central Heartland)

The Golden Dominion is the economic and spiritual heartland of Aethelgard. Its rolling hills are rich with crystallized Vitaflow deposits and its golden wheat fields literally glow with life energy. However, this apparent abundance carries a subtle undercurrent of the exploitation required to maintain it, hinting at the influence of the [[Vitaflow Merchants]] and the high cost of their 'efficiency'.

## Key Details
* **Capital**: [[Aurelius Prime]] â€“ A living city that pulses with collective Vitaflow.  
* **Geography**: Rolling hills of crystallized Vitaflow deposits and glowing golden wheat fields.  
* **Climate**: Temperate, with seasons that change based on the collective emotional resonance of the population.  
* **Trade Routes**: The Resonance Highway, a network of roads that amplify a traveler's Vitaflow for faster movement.  

## Unique Features & Landmarks
* **[[The Shattered Spire]]**: The site where Marcus first broke the Ceiling, now a pilgrimage destination. It serves as a constant and poignant reminder of the fragility of order and the potential for catastrophic change, foreshadowing the activation of the Lever.  
* **Vitaflow Mines**: Deep caverns where crystallized soul energy is harvested.  
* **The Merchant's Quarter**: Floating market districts that are powered by economic Vitaflow.  

## Culture & Society
The culture of the Golden Dominion is deeply intertwined with Vitaflow. Clothing is often made from shimmering, golden fabrics, with intricate embroidery depicting celestial maps and resonant patterns. Form-aligned individuals tend to wear structured garments with sharp lines, while those aligned with Wholeness prefer flowing, harmonious drapes. The region's prosperity is heavily managed by the [[Vitaflow Merchants]], and the populace lives with the subtle but pervasive effects of their exploitative efficiency.
