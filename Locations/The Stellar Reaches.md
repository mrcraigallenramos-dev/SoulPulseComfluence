# The Stellar Reaches
(Northern Wilderness)

The Stellar Reaches is Aethelgard's harsh and beautiful cosmic frontier. It is a land of eternal cold defined by tundra where aurora-like Stellar Resonance creates permanent light shows in the sky. This region serves as a connection to the wider cosmos, and its unique phenomena are subtly linked to the past actions of key figures.

## Key Details
* **Capital**: [[Starfall Observatory]] – A city built into a mountain that touches the cosmic void.  
* **Geography**: Tundra illuminated by permanent, aurora-like Stellar Resonance.  
* **Climate**: Eternally cold, but star-touched areas provide pockets of mystical warmth.  
* **Trade Routes**: The Void Paths – dangerous interdimensional shortcuts through space-time, linked to [[Jhace]]’s early, uncontrolled experiments.  

## Unique Features & Landmarks
* **[[The Cosmic Grove]]**: A forest of trees that grow not towards the sun, but towards distant stars. Said to hold ancient secrets and fragmented prophecies that hint at the true nature of the Rot.  
* **[[Gravity Wells]]**: Unstable areas where [[Jhace]]’s early experiments permanently warped the fabric of space-time.  
* **[[The Observatory Rings]]**: A series of massive, floating stone circles used to track the flow of cosmic Vitaflow.  

## Culture & Society
The unforgiving landscape of the Stellar Reaches has forged a culture that is resilient, independent, and deeply connected to cosmic forces. Its people, often referred to as the [[Stellar Reaches Nomads]], are less concerned with earthly politics and more with maintaining universal balance, making them difficult to sway by conventional means.
