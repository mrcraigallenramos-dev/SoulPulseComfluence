# ⚙️ Reality Engine Dashboard

The **Reality Engine** is the *diegetic control system* of the Confluence Chronicles vault.  
It ensures all documents, novellas, and forensic breadcrumbs interconnect as though they were part of the same living machine.

---

## 🔧 Narrative Control Levers

- **Saga Phase** → `Series 1: The Detonation`
- **Current Focus** → Novella 1.5 (*The Recalibration*)
- **Breadcrumb Fidelity** → High (use exact log strings, single appearances)
- **Tone Enforcement** → Grimdark Romantasy (grit, intimacy, betrayal, transcendence)
- **Primary POV Anchor** → Jhace (limited 3rd), opacity on Tiffani

## 📂 Active Document Families

- [[README]] → Vault overview & master index
- [[Novella Blueprints]] → Saga scaffolding, one per novella
- [[Forensic Snippets]] → Phase logs, error codes, resonance anomalies
- [[Chapter Drafts]] → Prose scenes with embedded forensic artifacts
- [[Interludes]] → Auditor-led vignettes bridging novellas

---

## 🧩 Core Design Principles

- **Every File is Dual** → Serves narrative function *and* feels like an in-universe record.
- **Breadcrumb Economy** → Exact anomalies (e.g., `phase_delta: +0.03 composite_anom`) must recur verbatim.
- **Auditor’s Eye** → Interludes and forensic logs should feel like surveillance artifacts, not narration.
- **Series Rhythm** → Each novella ends with both a personal climax (Jhace/Tiffani) and a systemic shift (awakening gods, structural flaws).

## 🎛 Engine Settings for Drafting

When generating prose:
1. Anchor every scene in **visceral sensory detail** (taste of copper, hum in molars, etc.).
2. Layer in **grit + intimacy** before spectacle.
3. Hide one breadcrumb per chapter (logline, watermark, biometric trace).
4. Maintain **opacity on Tiffani**: warmth up front, cold geometry hidden.
