# Eira Frostbound

| | |
|---|---|
| **Principle** | [[Stellar Resonance]] |
| **Core Trauma** | Being exiled from her home in the Stellar Reaches, possibly after a prophecy she delivered was misunderstood and led to disaster. This created a deep-seated fear of her own visions. |
| **Habits** | Subconsciously reading the frost patterns on cold surfaces; constantly gazing at the night sky; speaking in cryptic, often poetic fragments. |
| **Fears** | Her visions causing more harm than good; the profound isolation her powers create; being unable to change the terrible futures she foresees. |

## Overview
Eira Frostbound is an exiled mystic and seer from the frigid [[The Stellar Reaches]]. A prophetic voice who reads the future in frost patterns and auroras, she is a woman defined by her struggle between isolation and the need for belonging. Her visions of coming catastrophes force her into the orbit of the other heroes, but her prophecies are often double-edged, revealing dangers that she feels powerless to prevent.

## Deep Profile: The Living Soul

### Physicality & Presence
- **Stance & Movement**: Eira has a very still and contained presence, almost like a frozen statue. Her movements are slow, graceful, and deliberate, as if conserving heat and energy in a perpetually cold world.
- **Hands / Body Language**: Her body language is typically closed and defensive, a physical manifestation of the emotional walls she builds. Her hands are often tucked into the sleeves of her furs, and her gestures are rare but meaningful.
- **Face & Expression**: Her expression is usually a neutral, icy mask that hides her thoughts. Her eyes, however, are incredibly expressive—pale and sharp, they seem to be looking at something far away, seeing patterns in the air that others cannot.
- **Attire & Scent**: She is wrapped in layers of white and grey furs from the northern wilds, decorated with frost-crusted jewelry made of star-metal and ice crystals that never seem to melt. She smells of cold, clean air, pine, and the faint, sharp scent of ozone.

### Aesthetic of Power
- **Public / Mask**: Her mask is her cold, unreadable, and distant exterior. She does not project power in a traditional sense; she projects an aura of cold and isolation.
- **True / Core Resonance**: Her power is one of quiet, ominous beauty. It is not an active force but a receptive one. It manifests as intricate, prophetic images forming in the frost on a windowpane; the shimmering curtains of an aurora resolving into visions of a future battle; or a sudden, bone-deep chill that precedes a terrible revelation.

### Psychology & Mannerisms
- **Mindset / Coping Mechanisms**: Eira is a fatalist, burdened by the terrible futures she has witnessed. Her primary coping mechanism is emotional distance; she keeps others at arm's length to protect them from the ill omens she carries and to protect herself from the pain of connections she believes are doomed.
- **Tics & Habits**: She has a habit of tracing the patterns of frost on any available surface with a gloved finger. Her breath often mists in the air, even when the temperature isn't cold enough to warrant it.
- **Profanity & Verbal Style**: Eira does not use profanity. Her verbal style is cryptic, poetic, and sparse. She speaks in fragments of her visions, often leaving others to piece together her meaning. Her pronouncements are heavy with unspoken weight.

### Physiology & Appetites
- **The Cost of Power**: The constant channeling of Stellar Resonance has left her with a bone-deep, perpetual cold. She is always chilled, a physical manifestation of her connection to the frost and the void.
- **Substance Use / Habits**: She avoids any substance that could cloud the clarity of her visions. She craves warmth and is often seen nursing mugs of hot, spiced tea or broth, not just for sustenance but to combat the unshakeable cold within her.

## Resonant Abilities
Eira's abilities are unique to the seers of the Stellar Reaches.
- **Stellar Resonance Seership**: She is not a wielder of resonance but a reader of it. She can interpret the complex patterns in auroras, starlight, and frost to see fragmented, often symbolic, glimpses of possible futures.
- **Double-Edged Prophecies**: Her visions are always true in some form, but they are rarely literal and are often incomplete. This makes them dangerous, as a misinterpretation can be just as deadly as the event she is trying to warn against.

## Character Arc
Eira's journey is about moving from a passive, isolated observer of fate to an active participant who fights for a better future. Initially reluctant to share her visions for fear of causing harm, she is forced to engage with the "found family." Her arc is about learning to trust others with her fragmented knowledge and accepting that even if she can't prevent every catastrophe, her insight can still give her friends a fighting chance.

## Key Relationships
- **[[Kellan “Echo” Irons]]**: A key bond for her is a slow-burn romance with Kellan. His world of sound, mimicry, and warmth is the complete opposite of her silent, cold reality. Their journey is about learning how "ice and sound can harmonise," with each offering the other a balance they desperately need.
- **The Found Family**: She is initially an outsider, but her visions make her indispensable. She slowly, reluctantly, finds a sense of belonging among them, even if she fears it will end in tragedy.
- **Fate**: Her primary antagonist is Fate itself. She is in a constant struggle with the sense of powerlessness that comes from seeing a future that seems immutable.
