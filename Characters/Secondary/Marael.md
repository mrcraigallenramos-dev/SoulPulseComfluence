# Marael

| | |
|---|---|
| **Principle** | [[Wholeness]] (Leesa) |
| **Core Trauma** | Witnessing the deep-seated corruption within the [[The Resonance Tribunal]], which shattered her faith and forced her to abandon the institution she had devoted her life to serving. |
| **Habits** | Performing small, personal purification or blessing rites on her tools and surroundings; carefully tending to the ancient relics she carries; speaking in parables or quoting forgotten scripture. |
| **Fears** | Her own faith failing completely; that the pure, old ways she follows are truly lost; being hunted down by the Tribunal as a heretic. |

## Overview
Marael is a wandering priestess and soul caretaker, originally from [[The Healing Gardens]] and formerly a devout member of the Tribunal. Her life is a pilgrimage, defined by a crisis of faith after she became disillusioned with the order's corruption. She now follows her own personal creed of "resonant sanctity," offering wisdom and healing to those she meets. She often serves as the group's moral conscience, carrying the weight of her broken faith and the secret knowledge of ancient, often forbidden, Vitaflow rites.

## Deep Profile: The Living Soul

### Physicality & Presence
- **Stance & Movement**: Marael has a serene and graceful presence, though it is tinged with an underlying sadness. Her stance is calm and centered, a reflection of her priestly training. Her movements are slow, deliberate, and often have a ritualistic quality to them.
- **Hands / Body Language**: Her hands are often held in a placid, prayer-like gesture or are busy tending to the relics she carries. Her body language is gentle and non-threatening, projecting an aura of peace that can be comforting to those in turmoil.
- **Face & Expression**: Her expression is one of thoughtful melancholy. She has kind, knowing eyes that seem to have witnessed both divine grace and profound human failing. She offers a gentle, weary smile.
- **Attire & Scent**: She wears the well-worn but clean traveling cloaks of a pilgrim, often in shades of green and silver. Beneath, she may still wear the simple, unadorned robes of her former order. She carries a worn leather satchel containing ancient, softly pulsing relics. She smells of old parchment, sacred incense, and healing herbs like lavender and myrrh.

### Aesthetic of Power
- **Public / Mask**: Her power appears as a gentle, compassionate form of healing—a soft, silver light and a soothing hum that mends wounds and calms troubled minds. This is her standard, public practice of [[Wholeness]].
- **True / Core Resonance**: When she performs her secret, ancient rites, her resonance becomes far more potent and wild. It is an older, purer form of [[Wholeness]]. The aesthetic may involve glowing, ancient symbols forming in the air around her, a polyphonic chant that seems to come from multiple voices at once, and a light that feels both divinely comforting and dangerously powerful.

### Psychology & Mannerisms
- **Mindset / Coping Mechanisms**: Marael is a disillusioned believer who is actively trying to reconstruct her entire worldview. Her coping mechanism is to cling to the purity and perceived authenticity of the old rites and scriptures, finding a new, personal faith outside the corrupt institution she left behind.
- **Tics & Habits**: She has a habit of tracing the symbols on her relics with her thumb when deep in thought. When stressed, she may unconsciously clutch a holy symbol or begin whispering a quiet prayer.
- **Profanity & Verbal Style**: Marael does not use profanity, viewing it as a corruption of spirit and a form of dissonance. Her verbal style is thoughtful, calm, and often parabolic. She speaks in allegories and quotes forgotten texts, not to be obtuse, but because it is the framework through which she understands the world.

### Physiology & Appetites
- **The Cost of Power**: The cost of channeling the older, forbidden rites is a growing disconnect from the modern, structured world of the Tribunal. It attunes her to frequencies and spiritual echoes that others cannot perceive, which can be an isolating and sometimes frightening experience.
- **Substance Use / Habits**: She lives a simple, ascetic lifestyle. She would not use recreational substances, but likely uses a variety of ritual herbs for meditation, purification, and to aid in her visions. She sees food as simple sustenance, not a source of pleasure.

## Resonant Abilities
Marael is a powerful [[Wholeness]] resonant, but her knowledge sets her apart.
- **Advanced Healing**: She is a master healer, capable of mending deep physical and spiritual wounds.
- **Forbidden Rites**: Her true strength lies in her secret knowledge of ancient rites that predate the Tribunal. These can have powerful and unpredictable effects, such as performing a true soul-cleansing, warding off cosmic horrors, or communicating with the lingering echoes of the dead.
- **Sacred Lore**: She is a living repository of forgotten scriptures and historical knowledge, often providing the crucial context or solution that the group needs.

## Character Arc
Marael begins as a solitary wanderer, adrift after the collapse of her faith. Her arc is about finding a new purpose and a new "flock" to tend to within the found family. She must learn to reconcile her past devotion with the grim reality of the world and decide whether to keep her forbidden knowledge hidden or to wield it as a weapon against the very corruption that once broke her spirit. She evolves from a keeper of a dying faith to the founder of a new one.

## Key Relationships
- **The Found Family**: She acts as their moral and spiritual guide, a source of wisdom and calm in a chaotic world. Her faith-based perspective may sometimes clash with the more pragmatic or cynical members of the group.
- **[[The Resonance Tribunal]]**: Her primary antagonist. They represent the corruption that shattered her world and would view her practice of forbidden rites as dangerous heresy, making her a target.
- **[[Idrik “Rust” Tarn]] / [[Sylara Gloom]]**: She may form a bond with other disillusioned or outcast characters, finding a common ground in their shared experience of being outside the system and searching for a new path.
