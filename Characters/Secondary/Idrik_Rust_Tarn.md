# Idrik “Rust” Tarn

| | |
|---|---|
| **Principle** | [[Form]] / [[Decay]] Hybrid |
| **Core Trauma** | A catastrophic failure of one of his major inventions, which caused a structural collapse that killed innocent people and branded him a disgraced outcast. |
| **Habits** | Constant, nervous tinkering with his patchwork gear; compulsively scavenging ruins for useful parts; muttering to his machines as if they are disobedient children. |
| **Fears** | His creations failing and hurting more people; that he is fundamentally broken and beyond redemption; that the "curse" of decay that follows him is inescapable. |

## Overview
Idrik "Rust" Tarn is a brilliant but disgraced inventor from [[The Iron Republics]], now living as a tech-savvy outlaw. He is haunted by a past failure that earned him his nickname, as his unstable resonance causes the machines he builds to corrode and fail around him. He now scavenges the ruins of the world, providing jury-rigged solutions and unconventional weapons, driven by a desperate, often self-destructive, search for redemption.

## Deep Profile: The Living Soul

### Physicality & Presence
- **Stance & Movement**: Idrik is perpetually in motion, a bundle of nervous energy. His stance is often hunched and defensive, as if expecting a blow or for a piece of his own gear to explode. He moves with the quick, twitchy gestures of a man who survives by his wits and reflexes.
- **Hands / Body Language**: His hands are the hands of a master tinkerer—calloused, stained with chemicals and grease, and covered in a lattice of fine scars and burns. They are never still, always adjusting a dial, tightening a strap, or fiddling with a loose wire.
- **Face & Expression**: His face is often hidden behind a pair of large, multi-lensed goggles that he constantly pushes up or down his forehead. When visible, his expression is a mix of intense, hyper-focused intelligence and deep-seated weariness.
- **Attire & Scent**: His attire is a chaotic assembly of patchwork gear. He wears scavenged bits of armor over a stained duster with far too many pockets, all of it held together with straps, wires, and hope. He smells of rust, ozone from short-circuiting tech, and the sharp tang of chemical solvents.

### Aesthetic of Power
- **Public / Mask**: His mask is the persona of the cynical, genius inventor who can build anything from scrap. He projects a chaotic confidence in his unstable creations.
- **True / Core Resonance**: His power is the aesthetic of **tragic entropy**. His [[Form]] resonance allows him to see brilliant, complex designs in his mind, but his "curse" of [[Decay]] inevitably corrupts them in reality. His power manifests as sparks flying from overworked circuits, the groan of metal under stress, and a fine red dust of rust that seems to settle on everything he owns. His creations work, often brilliantly, but only for a short time before spectacularly failing.

### Psychology & Mannerisms
- **Mindset / Coping Mechanisms**: Idrik is trapped in a cycle of self-loathing and obsessive creation. His coping mechanism for his past failure is to lose himself in his work, believing that if he can just build one perfect, stable machine, he can atone for his sins. He is a genius constantly being undone by his own inherent flaw.
- **Tics & Habits**: His primary tic is constantly adjusting his goggles. He also mutters to his machines, sometimes encouraging them, sometimes cursing them.
- **Profanity & Verbal Style**: His speech is fast, clipped, and full of technical jargon that few others understand. He uses profanity frequently, but it's the swearing of pure frustration—"Fucking slag!", "It's all rusted to shit!", "Sparks and corrosion!"—aimed at his own cursed creations.

### Physiology & Appetites
- **The Cost of Power**: The entropic field that corrodes his machines also works on him. He may suffer from a persistent cough from inhaled metal dust, brittle nails, and joints that ache with a phantom corrosion. He seems to be in a state of slow, physical decay.
- **Substance Use / Habits**: He likely runs on cheap, powerful stimulants to keep working for days on end, followed by crashes. He might smoke a harsh, unfiltered cigarette or a similar substance, more to occupy his restless hands and mind than for any sense of pleasure.

## Resonant Abilities
Idrik's tragic hybrid resonance gives him a unique and unpredictable skillset.
- **Unstable Creation**: He can see the potential in any pile of scrap and jury-rig brilliant, unconventional weapons and gadgets. These devices are often more powerful than their professionally made counterparts but are dangerously unstable and prone to failure at the worst possible moment.
- **Weaponized Corrosion**: He can focus his aura of decay, allowing him to rapidly corrode enemy armor, jam their weapons, and sabotage enemy technology with a touch.

## Character Arc
Idrik's journey is a desperate search for redemption. He starts as a cynical outlaw, providing his dangerous tech to the highest bidder. As he becomes entangled with the other heroes, he is forced to confront his past and his fear of failure. His arc is about learning to accept his flawed, entropic nature and finding a way to turn his "curse" into a tool for good. His redemption will not come from building a perfect machine, but from embracing his imperfection and perhaps making a final, spectacular, and meaningful sacrifice.

---
## Key Relationships
- **[[Braxus Hammersong]]**: A natural rival. Braxus represents the perfect, traditional craftsmanship that Idrik can no longer achieve. Their relationship is one of mutual, grudging respect and professional friction.
- **[[Jhace]]**: Idrik might feel a reluctant admiration and jealousy for Jhace's ability to heal and mend things, a power that is the antithesis of his own corrosive nature.
- **His Past**: His primary antagonist is the ghost of his past failure. Every machine he builds is an argument against the man he used to be and a desperate attempt to prove he is not a monster.
