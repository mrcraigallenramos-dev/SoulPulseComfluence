# Braxus Hammersong

| | |
|---|---|
| **Principle** | [[Form]] / [[Wholeness]] Hybrid |
| **Core Trauma** | The God Shock causing a cathedral bell he was forging to explode, killing his favorite apprentice and deafening him in one ear. This event instilled in him a deep fear of unpredictable, chaotic resonance. |
| **Habits** | Subconsciously humming old forging-songs while working or thinking; tapping objects to test their "ring" or resonance; meticulously polishing his warhammer. |
| **Fears** | The old guild values of craftsmanship and honor being lost to cold, exploitative efficiency; his own creations failing or harming others; unpredictable chaos. |

## Overview
Braxus Hammersong is a veteran warrior and master smith from [[The Iron Republics]], a towering figure of a bygone era. His life is defined by the conflict between the industrialized, exploitative systems of his homeland and the old guild values of craftsmanship, honor, and song that he holds dear. He serves as a reluctant leader and gruff mentor to a younger generation of resonants, his unique power making him both a battlefield juggernaut and a bard-like keeper of tradition.

## Deep Profile: The Living Soul

### Physicality & Presence
- **Stance & Movement**: Braxus is a mountain of a man, and his stance is as solid and grounded as an anvil. He moves with a powerful deliberation, each step heavy and sure. There is a weariness in his posture, the stoop of a man who has carried heavy burdens—both literal and metaphorical—for a long time.
- **Hands / Body Language**: His hands are massive, covered in burns, callouses, and the fine, crisscrossing scars of the smithing trade. His arms are like tree trunks. His body language is often closed and stern, but it softens almost imperceptibly around children or when listening to an old guild-song.
- **Face & Expression**: His face is framed by a thick, heavy beard, often flecked with soot. His expression is typically a stern, uncompromising scowl, though it hides a deep-seated sadness. A prominent scar covers his deafened left ear.
- **Attire & Scent**: He wears the heavy leather apron of his trade over the functional, durable clothing of the Iron Republics. His attire is practical, stained, and built to last. He smells perpetually of the forge: coal smoke, hot metal, and quenching oil.

### Aesthetic of Power
- **Public / Mask**: His power is not hidden; it is as direct and imposing as he is. It is the deep, resonant hum that seems to emanate from his very being and the bell-like clarity of his warhammer's strikes.
- **True / Core Resonance**: His hybrid [[Form]]/[[Wholeness]] resonance is the aesthetic of **Harmonic Force**. When he channels his power, the air shimmers around him like a heat haze. Striking his hammer against a surface doesn't just impact; it releases a visible shockwave of sound and a pure, bell-like tone that can shatter armor or, when softened, soothe a troubled soul. He can make steel sing.

### Psychology & Mannerisms
- **Mindset / Coping Mechanisms**: Braxus is a staunch traditionalist. He copes with a world he no longer understands by clinging to the immutable truths of his craft: the purity of the forge, the honor of a well-made tool, and the stories held in old songs. He is a perfectionist, but his perfection is about soul and quality, not cold efficiency.
- **Tics & Habits**: He has a habit of testing the balance and integrity of any tool or weapon he picks up. When listening, he will often tilt his head, favoring his good ear.
- **Profanity & Verbal Style**: His voice is a low, rumbling bass. His speech is gruff and direct. His profanity is tied to his trade: "Cracked casting," "By my father's broken tongs," "Scrap and slag."

### Physiology & Appetites
- **The Cost of Power**: The constant internal resonance he maintains has cost him much of his hearing and leaves him with a perpetual low-grade ringing in his ears. Overuse of his power can leave him feeling "out of tune," a state of jarring disorientation that can only be fixed by the familiar rhythm of working his forge.
- **Substance Use / Habits**: He is a man of simple, hearty appetites. He would favor strong, dark ale and dense bread—the food of a working man. He has no patience for frivolous or mind-altering substances.

## Resonant Abilities
Braxus's resonance is a unique blend of structure and harmony, allowing him to manipulate sound and vibration.
- **Sonic Amplification**: He can channel resonance through his warhammer, turning each strike into a sonic blast that can shatter stone and deafen foes.
- **Harmonic Reinforcement**: By "singing" to metal as he forges it, he can imbue weapons and armor with a controlled resonance that makes them incredibly durable and resistant to decay or corruption.
- **Bardic Resonance**: He can use the old guild-songs and sagas as a form of resonant storytelling, projecting the sounds and feelings of the past into the minds of his listeners.

## Character Arc
Braxus begins as a rigid traditionalist, an obstacle to the more chaotic resonance of the younger generation. He is caught between his loyalty to the Iron Republics and his disgust with their modern, exploitative methods. His arc is about learning to adapt. He is forced to become a reluctant leader, realizing that to preserve the "soul" of the old ways, he must protect the new generation of resonants, even if he doesn't approve of their methods. He evolves from a guardian of the past into a mentor for the future.

## Key Relationships
- **Younger Resonants ([[Jhace]], [[Kellan “Echo” Irons]], etc.)**: He acts as a gruff, reluctant protector and mentor. He is frustrated by their recklessness but is honor-bound to guide and defend them.
- **[[Idrik “Rust” Tarn]]**: A rival and a representation of everything Braxus fears. Idrik's unstable, corrosive resonance is the antithesis of Braxus's controlled, harmonic craft.
- **[[Calix]]**: He would view Calix's philosophy of pure efficiency as a soulless perversion of the true purpose of industry and craftsmanship.
- **The Old Guild Values**: His most profound relationship is with the abstract ideals of his craft. He is fighting to keep the "song" in the metal in a world that only cares about the speed of production.
