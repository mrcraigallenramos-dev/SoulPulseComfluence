# Vael

| | |
|---|---|
| **Principle** | [[Decay]] (Seeri) |
| **Core Trauma** | Witnessing a profound betrayal or systemic deception that shattered her belief in ideals, fueling an obsession with the cold, hard "truth" of consequences. |
| **Habits** | Meticulously auditing tether ledgers; a constant, slight tremor in her hands; speaking with brutal honesty. |
| **Fears** | A brittle, false harmony built on lies; the catastrophic collapse from a single, centralized risk created by reckless "heroes." |

## Overview
Vael is a state enforcer and resonance hunter, tasked with auditing the metaphysical tethers that bind the world. A complex figure who serves as both antagonist and eventual ally, she is a cynical pragmatist who embraces necessary endings, believing that messy destruction is preferable to a fragile, unsustainable order. Haunted by a past betrayal, her arc is a journey from a cynical enforcer of harsh truths to finding something, or someone, worth believing in and protecting.

## Deep Profile: The Living Soul

### Physicality & Presence
- **Stance & Movement**: Vael stands with the grounded, immovable posture of an enforcer. Her movements are deliberate and efficient, never hurried. She carries an aura of weary authority, her presence in a room instantly raising the tension as if she's making the air itself heavier.
- **Hands / Body Language**: Her most defining physical trait is the constant, slight tremor in her hands—a visible manifestation of the cost of her Decay resonance. She often clenches them into fists or braces them on a table to still them. Her body language is closed-off and direct, projecting a clear "do not approach" signal.
- **Face & Expression**: Her expression is typically a stern, neutral mask. She is a keen observer, and her eyes seem to see the cracks and flaws in everything and everyone. She is haunted by the truths she has uncovered, and this gives her a look of perpetual, cynical weariness.
- **Attire & Scent**: Vael's attire is a practical, durable uniform of dark, reinforced leather or canvas, designed for utility and intimidation, not comfort. It is well-maintained but shows signs of hard use. She smells of old paper and ink from her tether ledgers, and the faint, metallic scent of dust and rust.

### Aesthetic of Power
- **Public / Mask**: Vael does not have a mask; her power is as blunt as her personality. Its initial manifestation is subtle—the sudden groan of stressed metal in her presence, the slight fading of color in a vibrant tapestry, the faint scent of ozone and decay.
- **True / Core Resonance**: Her [[Decay]] resonance is the aesthetic of inevitable collapse. When she fully unleashes it, it is not an explosion of light but an oppressive wave of entropy. Colors dull, sounds muffle, and structures begin to crumble as she accelerates their return to dust. Her **Overtone State** is a terrifying aura of withering that saps the strength from enemies and turns their weapons to rust in their hands.

### Psychology & Mannerisms
- **Mindset / Coping Mechanisms**: Vael is a cynic who finds comfort in the cold, hard logic of her ledgers. She believes in balance through destruction: pruning a sick branch is necessary to save the tree. Her core philosophy is that "saving someone on credit is not salvation" because it centralizes risk. This rigid adherence to the "math" of consequences is her way of coping with a chaotic world.
- **Tics & Habits**: Aside from the tremor, she has a habit of running a thumb along the edge of her datapad or a ledger, as if feeling for imperfections. She is a creature of routine and discipline.
- **Profanity & Verbal Style**: Vael finds profanity emotionally imprecise and inefficient. Her truth is sharper than any curse. Her speech is blunt, stripped of all pleasantries, and often framed in the language of audits and equations. She doesn't threaten; she lays out the inevitable, disastrous consequences of one's actions.

### Physiology & Appetites
- **The Cost of Power**: Her resonance is slowly unraveling her own body, manifesting as the permanent tremor in her hands. This is a constant, low-level physical deterioration. Each major use of her power accelerates this decay slightly.
- **Substance Use / Habits**: She would use substances sparingly, if at all, as they could interfere with her focus. However, she would likely have a taste for something bitter and strong—like unsweetened black coffee or a harsh, straight spirit—to keep her senses sharp and grounded.

## Resonant Abilities
As a powerful [[Decay]] resonant, Vael's abilities are focused on entropy and the truth of collapse.
- **Tether Auditing**: She can "read" the tether IDs connected to a resonant, allowing her to track their impact on the world and assess the risk they pose.
- **Accelerated Entropy**: She can accelerate the natural process of decay, rusting armor, crumbling structures, and unraveling spells.
- **Fracture Perception**: Her power allows her to intuitively see the weak points—both physical and metaphysical—in any system, person, or argument.

## Character Arc
Vael begins the saga as a cynical antagonist to [[Jhace]], seeing his reckless acts of heroism as the creation of a massive, centralized risk that will inevitably collapse. Her initial role is to enforce the hard limits of resonance. Her arc involves finding something worth believing in beyond the cold math of her ledgers. Through her interactions with Jhace's found family, particularly the innocent [[Ember (The Null Child)]], she begins to see that some risks are necessary and that not all truths must lead to destruction, transforming from a pure enforcer into a reluctant protector and ally.

---
## Key Relationships
- **[[Jhace]]**: Her primary point of conflict and, eventually, grudging respect. She sees him as a dangerous, chaotic variable, but she is also forced to witness the genuine good he creates.
- **[[Ember (The Null Child)]]**: Ember's vulnerability and unique Null nature could be the catalyst for Vael's change. Her protective instinct towards Ember forces her to act outside the strict logic of her duties.
- **The System**: Her primary relationship is with the rules she enforces. Her greatest conflict is when her duty to the system clashes with a newfound personal morality.
