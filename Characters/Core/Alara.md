|---|---|
| **Principle** | [cite_start][[Wholeness]] (Leesa) [cite: 3] |
| **Core Trauma** | [cite_start]Witnessing the suffering caused by the [[The Resonance Tribunal|Tribunal's]] rigid, uncompassionate control, which instilled in her a deep distrust of absolute authority[cite: 3]. |
| **Habits** | Tending to medicinal herbs; keeping detailed healing journals; a tendency to put others' needs far above her own. |
| **Fears** | [cite_start]Failing to protect the innocent; that her attempts to save people will inadvertently cause more harm; being unable to prevent a terrible prophecy she discovered[cite: 3, 1]. |

## Overview
[cite_start]Alara is a deeply compassionate and skilled healer from [[The Healing Gardens]], driven by a need to protect the vulnerable and build networks of care in a broken world[cite: 3]. [cite_start]She initially serves as a moral center and mentor figure, but her journey is defined by a tragic choice[cite: 1, 3]. [cite_start]After discovering a prophecy that [[Jhace]] and [[Tiffani]] will cause the world's end, she is forced to betray her friends in a desperate attempt to save millions, creating a powerful and heart-wrenching moral ambiguity that ripples through the saga[cite: 3].

## Deep Profile: The Living Soul

### Physicality & Presence
- **Stance & Movement**: Alara possesses a calm, gentle presence that puts others at ease. Her stance is open and empathetic, and she moves with the deliberate, soothing grace of a practiced healer.
- **Hands / Body Language**: Her hands are her primary tools, and they are always clean, with neatly trimmed nails and a surprising strength in their grip. Her body language is nurturing—a comforting hand on a shoulder, a steadying presence in a chaotic room.
- **Face & Expression**: Her face is kind, with expressive eyes that reflect a deep well of empathy. She is a poor liar, as her genuine emotions are almost always visible in her expression.
- **Attire & Scent**: She wears the practical, layered robes of a traveling healer, often in greens and earth tones, made of natural fibers. Her clothes are functional, with numerous hidden pockets and pouches for herbs, crystals, and medical tools. She smells of medicinal plants like willow-bark and Glimmer Moss.

### Aesthetic of Power
- **Public / Mask**: Alara has no mask; her power is a direct reflection of her soul. Her [[Wholeness]] resonance is a gentle and restorative force.
- **True / Core Resonance**: Her power manifests as soft, glowing light in shades of green and rose-gold. It appears as harmonic ribbons of energy that visibly knit wounds closed, a calming aura that eases pain and fear, and in more powerful expressions, large-scale protective barriers that absorb and dissipate harmful energy.

### Psychology & Mannerisms
- **Mindset / Coping Mechanisms**: She is a caregiver to her core. Her coping mechanism for the world's overwhelming pain is to try and heal all of it, a noble but unsustainable drive that often leads to her own burnout and self-neglect. She believes fervently that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, a philosophy that drives her to her ultimate, tragic betrayal.
- **Tics & Habits**: Her habits are all related to her work. She often grinds herbs with a mortar and pestle to calm her nerves or methodically cleans her medical tools while thinking through a problem.
- **Profanity & Verbal Style**: Alara rarely, if ever, uses profanity. Her words are another tool for healing, and her verbal style is consistently calm, reassuring, and thoughtful, even when delivering difficult news.

### Physiology & Appetites
- **The Cost of Power**: As a powerful [[Wholeness]] resonant, she feels a shadow of the pain from every wound she mends. This leads to chronic emotional and physical exhaustion. Taking on too much at once can leave her drained, weak, and dangerously numb.
- **Substance Use / Habits**: She does not use recreational substances. She relies on herbal teas, tinctures, and meditation to center herself and manage the constant emotional toll of her work.

## Resonant Abilities
As a master of [[Wholeness]], Alara's abilities are focused on restoration and protection.
- **Trauma Healing**: She specializes in healing not just the physical body, but the spiritual and emotional wounds left behind by trauma.
- **Healing Networks**: She can create and sustain large "networks" of healing energy, allowing her to care for entire communities at once.
- [cite_start]**Prophetic Insight**: Her deep connection to the World Spine grants her occasional, fragmented visions of the future, which is how she discovers the prophecy about Tiffani and Jhace[cite: 3].

## Character Arc
Alara begins as a beacon of hope, building healing networks in the wake of the God Shock. Her arc is defined by the terrible burden of her prophetic knowledge. [cite_start]Believing she is choosing the lesser of two evils, she makes a calculated move against Tiffani and Jhace to "save the flock by culling the shepherds," a choice that brands her a traitor in the eyes of her friends but, in her mind, saves the world from annihilation[cite: 1, 3, 2]. This act of betrayal, born from compassion, makes her one of the saga's most morally complex and tragic figures.

## Key Relationships
- **[[Quinlan Ashvale]]**: Her primary romantic bond. Theirs is a slow-burn, trauma-bonded relationship forged in the crucible of rebellion. [cite_start]His paranoia and her fear of intimacy create constant tension, but they find solace in their shared distrust of authority[cite: 1].
- **[[Jhace]] & [[Tiffani]]**: She starts as a mentor figure to them but becomes their first major betrayer. Her actions are not driven by malice but by a desperate, misguided belief that she is saving the world from them, making their relationship incredibly fraught and tragic.
- **The Vulnerable**: Her truest allegiance is to the innocent victims of the world's conflicts. [cite_start]She is the fierce protector of the "317 children" and others who cannot defend themselves[cite: 2].
