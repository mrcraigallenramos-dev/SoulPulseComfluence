## Overview
Jhace is a brilliant mechanic and resonance prodigy whose core instinct is to bind and heal. His power as a [[Wholeness]] resonant makes him deeply empathetic, but he struggles with the immense weight of others' emotions, leaving him prone to emotional overwhelm without a proper anchor. He desperately seeks stability and genuine connection to ground himself.

## Deep Profile: The Living Soul

### Physicality & Presence
**Stance & Movement**
Jhace carries himself with the quiet tension of someone trying not to take up too much space. His default stance is slightly coiled, shoulders canted forward from years spent hunched over engines and workbenches. He moves with a mechanic's economy of motion�no wasted steps, no dramatic gestures. The only time his posture straightens to its full, imposing height is when he is deep in the act of resonance, a brief moment where the fear leaves him and he becomes a pure conduit of power.

**The Mechanic's Hands**
To understand Jhace, you must understand his hands. They are a map of his life. The palms are thick with callouses, cross-hatched with a hundred faint, white scars from slipped wrenches and sharp-edged metal. There's a permanent line of grease etched into the whorls of his fingerprints. Yet, for all their roughness, they are incredibly sensitive and precise. When he uses his Wholeness resonance, a soft, golden light emanates from these same rough hands, and their movements become impossibly gentle.

**Face & Expression**
His default expression is one of deep, quiet focus. His dark eyes are often distant as he processes the low-grade hum of emotional static from everyone around him. To avoid being overwhelmed, he often avoids direct eye contact, focusing on people's hands or the ground. When he does meet someone's gaze, it's intense and deeply empathetic�he sees more than most people are comfortable with, and he knows it.

**Attire & Scent**
His clothing is purely functional, chosen for durability over style. He favors heavy canvas trousers with reinforced knees, worn leather work boots with scuffed steel toes, and a dark, heavy jacket with a dozen hidden pockets filled with tools, a tuning fork, and folded schematics. He smells faintly of ozone, hot metal, and the sharp, clean scent of machine oil.

### Psychology & Mannerisms
**The Sound of Souls**
For Jhace, empathy is a constant sensory input, like hearing a thousand radios playing at once on low volume. This is why he craves the "clean" and predictable resonance of machines; a well-tuned engine is a single, perfect note in a world of emotional chaos. Being alone or with trusted individuals is the only time the noise fades.

**Tics & Habits**
- **Tapping:** His fingers are rarely still. He's constantly tapping out silent, complex rhythms on his thigh or a workbench. It's a subconscious act of tuning�an attempt to find a clear, steady rhythm to focus on amidst the emotional static.
- **Compulsive Fixing:** He cannot stand to see something broken or misaligned. He will unconsciously straighten a crooked picture frame or tighten a loose bolt on a chair, a manifestation of his core desire for order and wholeness.

**Profanity & Verbal Style**
- **Verbal Rhythm**: Jhace is generally a man of few words, a listener more than a talker. His speech is often concise and practical. When he's emotionally overwhelmed, his rhythm can become hesitant or clipped. With those he trusts, his primary form of communication is the non-verbal **forearm tap-code** he develops with [[Tiffani]].
- **Profanity**: His swearing is direct, sharp, and visceral�the functional curses of a mechanic under pressure. He uses profanity as a release valve for intense frustration or stress. Common curses include "Fuck," "shit," and "gods damn it," often directed at a situation or machine, like muttering "Fucking piece of scrap."

### Physiology & Appetites
**The Cost of Power**
A major healing leaves him feeling spiritually hollowed out, which manifests as a profound physical hunger for simple, hearty food to feel grounded. A massive act of resonance like a [[Fathombreak]] causes direct physical trauma: bleeding from the ears, burst capillaries in his eyes, and a tremor in his hands that can last for days.

**Substance Use**
Jhace **does not smoke** or use any reality-altering substances. His life is a struggle for control, and the idea of willingly inviting more chaos or fuzzying his senses is terrifying to him. He craves clarity and silence above all else.

## Resonant Abilities
As a [[Wholeness]] resonant, Jhace has a natural talent for mending gears, healing wounds, and harmonizing discordant hearts; it is said he can feel every fracture he knits back together. His power also allows him to sense and manipulate the emotional states of large groups to calm crowds and prevent violence, earning him the title "The Cleaner". After a devastating betrayal triggers his [[Fathombreak]], his power grows to a cosmic scale, but he becomes addicted to the sensation of saving people, creating vast networks of dangerous [[Vitaflow#Tether IDs|tethers]] in the process.

## Character Arc
Jhace's journey is one of transforming from a volatile outcast into a master of his abilities, learning to channel his overwhelming emotional resonance rather than suppress it. He begins as a 17-year-old folk hero, a brilliant mechanic capable of laying a flawless weld.

Unbeknownst to him, he is the unwitting instrument of [[Tiffani]]'s grand design. Over the course of the saga, she acts as his emotional anchor, manipulating him through a meticulously crafted romance and conditioning him into the perfect cosmic weapon she needs to destroy the awakened gods.

Forced through a series of escalating crises and betrayals in locations like [[The Iron Republics]], he develops a ruthless, pragmatic side to survive. His journey culminates in him being forced to make an impossible choice between sacrificing himself or unleashing an [[Fathombreak#Exile Dirge|Exile Dirge]]. In the end, he becomes the silent guardian of a new, imperfect harmony, a living embodiment of [[The Broken Tone]].

## Key Relationships
* **[[Tiffani]]**: His anchor, his partner, and his ultimate manipulator. Their [[Soul Bonding|soul bond]] is the central relationship of the saga. While he believes their love is the source of his stability, it is in fact the tool she uses to forge and control him.
* **Found Family**: Jhace forms genuine, non-manipulative bonds with figures like **[[Ember (The Null Child)]]**, **[[Vael]]**, and **Brighlee**, who serve as his true moral compass and support system.
