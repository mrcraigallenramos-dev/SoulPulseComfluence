# Brighlee

| | |
|---|---|
| **Principle** | [[Wholeness]] (Leesa) - Manifests as Amplification |
| **Core Trauma** | Witnessing a disaster or injustice that was officially covered up, igniting a fierce, lifelong dedication to uncovering and reporting the truth. |
| **Habits** | Constantly taking notes on a datapad or scrap of paper; asking probing, often uncomfortable questions; a quick, infectious laugh. |
| **Fears** | The truth being permanently buried; her words being twisted to harm others; being unable to protect her found family with "soft" skills in a hard world. |

## Overview
Brighlee is an energetic and relentlessly inquisitive journalist who becomes the emotional anchor and source of levity for Jhace's found family. Less concerned with the cosmic scale of the conflict and more with its impact on ordinary people, she provides a vital, grounding human perspective. Her fierce idealism and dedication to the truth make her an essential, if unconventional, force in the fight against systems of control and deception.

## Deep Profile: The Living Soul

### Physicality & Presence
- **Stance & Movement**: Brighlee is a whirlwind of motion. Her stance is alert and often leaning forward, a physical manifestation of her endless curiosity. She moves with a quick, energetic pace, equally at home navigating a chaotic street market or a tense political meeting.
- **Hands / Body Language**: Her hands are rarely still, either stained with ink or flying across a datapad's interface. Her body language is open, expressive, and engaging, which she uses to disarm sources and get them to talk.
- **Face & Expression**: Her face is a canvas for her emotions—quick to laugh, quick to show concern, and sharp with focus when on the trail of a story. Her primary expression is one of bright, probing intelligence.
- **Attire & Scent**: Her attire is a hodgepodge of practicality and personal flair. She wears durable trousers and boots suitable for a reporter on the move, but always with a uniquely colorful scarf, a collection of mismatched bracelets, or some other accessory that speaks to her vibrant personality. She smells of ink, old paper, and whatever street food she grabbed on her way to the next lead.

### Aesthetic of Power
- **Public / Mask**: For most of the saga, Brighlee is perceived as a non-resonant human, her only "power" being her sharp mind and relentless journalism. This is her effective mask.
- **True / Core Resonance**: Her [[Wholeness]] resonance is unique and subtle: **Amplification**. She cannot generate much power herself, but she can act as a living catalyst for others. When she focuses on an ally, their own resonance flares dramatically—[[Jhace]]'s healing light becomes warmer and more potent, [[Vael]]'s aura of Decay becomes sharper and more focused. Visually, it's as if she is a lens focusing a beam of light into a searing point.

### Psychology & Mannerisms
- **Mindset / Coping Mechanisms**: Brighlee is a fierce idealist. She copes with the grim realities of her world through a biting sense of humor and an unshakable belief that exposing the truth can change things for the better. She is the group's conscience, constantly pushing them to consider the bigger picture and the human cost of their actions.
- **Tics & Habits**: She has a habit of tapping her pen against her teeth or a datapad while thinking through a complex problem. She is also a notorious eavesdropper, always trying to catch a stray piece of information.
- **Profanity & Verbal Style**: Her verbal style is fast, witty, and peppered with questions. She uses modern profanity not out of anger, but for humorous emphasis or to build rapport with her sources, much like a street-wise journalist. Her banter is a tool she uses to both lighten the mood and to probe for weaknesses in an argument.

### Physiology & Appetites
- **The Cost of Power**: The cost of her amplification ability is a severe life-force drain. Acting as a conduit for another's power leaves her utterly exhausted and physically vulnerable, like a battery that has been completely emptied.
- **Substance Use / Habits**: Brighlee is the most likely member of the core group to have a vice. She might smoke a local, marijuana-like herb, not out of despair, but as a social habit or a way to unwind and process the day's horrors. She runs on adrenaline, caffeine, and a relentless drive that often leads her to neglect her own well-being.

## Resonant Abilities
Brighlee's primary ability is a rare form of [[Wholeness]] resonance.
- **Resonance Amplification**: She can act as a powerful conduit, taking in an ally's Soulpulse and amplifying it dramatically. This allows a single resonant to achieve effects that would normally require a whole group, making her the ultimate force multiplier and support character.

## Character Arc
Brighlee's arc is about discovering that her "human" skills—her journalism, her empathy, her ability to connect people—are just as vital as the cosmic power wielded by her friends. She starts as an idealistic reporter looking for a story and finds herself becoming part of the story's heart. Her journey culminates in a moment of heroic sacrifice, where she uses her amplification ability to its absolute limit, burning out her own life force to give her friends the power they need to defeat a god-level threat.

## Key Relationships
- **[[Jhace]]**: She is his intellectual sparring partner and a source of levity. Their relationship is built on playful banter and philosophical debate, and she constantly pushes him to remember the people he is fighting for.
- **[[Vael]]**: Their dynamic is one of mutual respect between two very different but equally strong women. Brighlee's wit bounces off Vael's stoicism, and they find a surprising common ground in their shared dedication to their respective codes.
- **The Truth**: Her most profound and antagonistic relationship is with the truth itself, and by extension, with those who seek to suppress it, such as [[Tiffani]] and [[Calix]].
