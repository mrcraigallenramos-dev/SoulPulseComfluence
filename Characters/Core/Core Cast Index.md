# Core Cast Index

The eight central figures of *The Confluence Chronicles*, each embodying a different facet of the Principles and their moral tensions.

| Character | Principle | Faction | Status | Thematic Role |
|-----------|-----------|---------|--------|---------------|
| [[Jhace]] | [[Wholeness]] (Leesa) | Independent | Alive | Protagonist; The Cleaner, bound to heal but addicted to connection. |
| [[Tiffani]] | [[Form]] (Xilcore) (disguised as [[Wholeness]]) | Independent (Manipulator) | Active (Cosmic Entity) | Antagonist; The Counter-Spark, cosmic auditor seeking to end the argument of creation. |
| [[Ember (The Null Child)]] | [[Null]] | Aligned with Jhace | Deceased | Innocence; paradoxical void-child who can silence resonance. |
| [[Calix]] | [[Form]] / [[Null\|Void]] | [[The Iron Republics]] | Unknown (lost in Hollowgate) | Dark mirror; utilitarian architect of ordered erasure. |
| [[Vael]] | [[Decay]] (Seeri) | State Enforcers | Alive | Cynic-turned-ally; enforcer of hard truths seeking balance in endings. |
| [[Lysandra Vane]] | [[Dissonance]] / [[Form]] | [[The Twilight Courts]] | Deceased | Ambition; strategist who weaponizes order and chaos, undone by her own game. |
| [[Alara]] | [[Wholeness]] (Leesa) | [[The Healing Gardens]] | Alive | Moral compass and betrayer; healer who sacrifices trust to prevent prophecy. |
| [[Brighlee]] | [[Wholeness]] (Leesa, Amplification) | Independent Journalist | Deceased (Potential) | Conscience; truth-teller and amplifier whose final act is sacrificial. |

## Notes
- The cast embodies **all four Principles** (Wholeness, Form, Decay, Dissonance) plus **Null** as an outlier.  
- Their arcs interlock into a cycle of **betrayal, sacrifice, and found family**, with each character forcing Jhace to confront a different moral failure or temptation.
