# Chapter 1 â€” The Price of a Scar

**Purpose:** Establish personal stakes and introduce systemic threat; deepen Tiffani/Jhace bond.

**Core Beats**
- Clinic/workshop aftermath of turbine failure. Tiffani in a resonant brace.
- Jhace tends her; guilt and protective instincts are clear.
- News: Calix's "Efficiency Index" flags the Foundry House IV turbine for shutdown in 48 hours.

**POV:** Jhace (limited 3rd).

**End Cliff:** Council vote to shut down the turbine in 48 hours, threatening Tiffani's healing.
