# Chapter 2 — A Ticking Clock

**Purpose:** Escalate stakes; show powerlessness vs bureaucracy.

**Core Beats**
- Tiffani's brace falters as turbine throttling begins.
- Jhace seeks alternatives; hits bureaucratic indifference.
- Forensic breadcrumb: `phase_delta = –3.00` appears in public logs; Jhace dismisses it.

**End Beat:** Tiffani hints at "another way" — an efficiency heresy.
