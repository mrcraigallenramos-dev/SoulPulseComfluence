# Forensic Snippets — Novella 1.2

Use these exact strings as searchable artifacts across the saga. Keep copies in character, faction, and investigation notes so investigators can trace manipulations.

- `phase_delta = –3.00`  # early recurring error code
- `phase_delta: +0.03 composite_anom [Jhace/Tiffani] timestamp 00:42:11`  # major composite log
- `experimental/wholeness_duet/01`  # private early duet log
- `debug_vault: remote_override approved`  # vault access ping
- `phase_bias = +0.97`  # finale log line copied by Lysandra
- `Mobel`  # accidental seed name in security clip
- `auditor/anon-000`  # nonstandard header used for offsite copies

Keep a canonical record of these strings and reuse them verbatim in later files.
