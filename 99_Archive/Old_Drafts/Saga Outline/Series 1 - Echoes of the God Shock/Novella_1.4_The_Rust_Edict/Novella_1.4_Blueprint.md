## Chapter Beats

### Chapter 1: "Dust in the Weld"
- **Purpose**: Revisit the saga's inciting incident and establish the haunting sense of an unsolved problem.
- **Core Beats**:
  - Jhace inspects the original weld from Novella 1.1; diagnostic tuner shows persistent `+0.03s ghost timestamp`. He feels it as a **hum in silence** — a note no one else can sense.
  - Tiffani steadies his wrist, intimate and supportive. Jhace voices unease, she reassures him with calm logic.
- **POV**: Jhace (limited 3rd).
- **Word Target**: 800–1,200.
- **End Beat**: A low groan echoes citywide — structural failure imminent.

---

### Chapter 2: "The Red Bloom"
- **Purpose**: Catalyst. Compassion’s unintended flaw manifests catastrophically.
- **Core Beats**:
  - The Foundry Bridge collapses. Metal turns to **red rust bloom**, echoing the sabotaged crate in 1.1.
  - Panic grips the city. Calix issues the infamous **Rust Edict**, seizing control of all resources.
- **POV**: Neutral (city-wide), then Jhace realization.
- **Word Target**: 900–1,300.
- **End Beat**: Newsfeeds show the collapse pattern matches their flawed alloy.

---

### Chapter 3: "A Mercy Weapon"
- **Purpose**: Debate. Reckoning with guilt.
- **Core Beats**:
  - Entire infrastructure built from Compassion Protocol alloy is failing. They caused this.
  - Debate: confess (be branded terrorists) or fix in secret.
  - Tiffani proposes scaling Jhace’s brace logic into a **city-wide Wholeness lattice**.
- **POV**: T&J, intimate.
- **Word Target**: 800–1,100.
- **End Beat**: They commit to the lattice plan.

---

### Chapter 4: "The City on Stitches"
- **Purpose**: Fun & Games. Intimate synergy during massive work.
- **Core Beats**:
  - They weave the lattice in the city’s tunnels. Their **tap-code** serves as tempo.
  - Light-cages bloom beautifully across districts.
  - Jhace unconsciously tags each node with **brace-serial IDs**, incriminating evidence.
- **POV**: T&J.
- **Word Target**: 1,000–1,400.

---

### Interlude A: "The Unseen Accountant"
- **Purpose**: Bad Guys Close In. Someone notices the patterns.
- **Core Beats**:
  - A low-level state auditor connects all breadcrumbs:  
    - mirrored watermark (1.1)  
    - `phase_delta` anomaly (1.2)  
    - `-3 cents` drift (1.3)  
    - `phase_bias = +0.97` (holiday log).  
  - Realizes all "mercies" stem from one flaw.
- **Word Target**: 300–500.
- **End Beat**: Sends encrypted anonymous tip upwards.

---

### Chapter 6: "The Ringing of Bells"
- **Purpose**: Midpoint / False Victory.
- **Core Beats**:
  - Lattice activates; groaning ceases. Infrastructure stabilized. Bells ring.
  - Calix pauses Rust Edict, praising “anonymous civic engineers.”
  - Tiffani’s tight smile hints fragility.
- **POV**: Public, then intimate.
- **Word Target**: 700–900.

---

### Chapter 7: "The Lattice Bites Back"
- **Purpose**: All Is Lost.
- **Core Beats**:
  - Lattice resonance anti-phases with World Spine, fueled by **-3 cents drift**.
  - Implosions tear through tunnels; **red rust blooms** choke the city.
- **POV**: Jhace POV.
- **Word Target**: 1,000–1,300.
- **End Beat**: Overload threatens total chain reaction.

---

### Interlude B: "The Fourth Decay"
- **Purpose**: Seed final mortal god.
- **Core Beats**:
  - Eries, a scavenger, finds corrupted alloy in bridge ruins. Feels prophecy in entropy.
- **Word Target**: 250–400.
- **End Beat**: Auditor notes: “Eries — Entropy accepted. The final argument is seeded.”

---

### Chapter 9: "The Auditor's Equation"
- **Purpose**: Dark Night of the Soul.
- **Core Beats**:
  - Anonymous message: all mercies = one failure. Math undeniable.
  - Jhace crushed, silent, refuses tap-code.  
- **POV**: Jhace.
- **Word Target**: 800–1,100.
- **End Beat**: Tiffani insists: only a **Fathombreak** can stop it.

---

### Chapter 10: "The Silent Overtone"
- **Purpose**: Finale.
- **Core Beats**:
  - Jhace attempts **Fathombreak**, resonance-deaf, guided only by Tiffani’s taps. Blind trust.
  - He dissolves lattice into dust. City saved.
  - EMT cuff-sync logs biometric string:  
    ```
    biom_signature: JH-Δ.42 | BPM: 187 (sync unstable)
    ```
  - Calix observes, linking biometrics to future security systems.
  - Final image: dust glittering with **brace-serial IDs**.
- **POV**: Jhace, final neutral forensic shot.
- **Word Target**: 1,300–1,800.
