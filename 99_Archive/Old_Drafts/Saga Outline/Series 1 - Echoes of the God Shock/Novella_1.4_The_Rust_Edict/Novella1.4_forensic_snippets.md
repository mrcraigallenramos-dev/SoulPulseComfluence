# Forensic Breadcrumbs — Novella 1.4

* Jhace’s weld still shows ghost timestamp:
  ```
  +0.03s
  ```
* Foundry Bridge collapses into **red rust bloom**, mirroring sabotaged crate in 1.1.
* Each lattice facet tagged with incriminating **brace-serial IDs**.
* Low-level auditor links anomalies:
  - `phase_delta` (1.1)
  - `phase_bias = +0.97` (1.2)
  - `–3 cents resonance drift` (1.3)
* EMT cuff-sync captures Jhace’s unique biometrics during Fathombreak.
