# Novella 1.3: The Humane Compromise (Blueprint)

**Series**: Echoes of the God Shock — Novella 1.3  
**Word Target**: 12k–20k  
**Core Ironic Seed**: The humane solution Jhace believes he invented is, in fact, a weaponized technology Tiffani and Calix are feeding into the world. Compassion becomes the wedge that weakens the World Spine.

**Synopsis**  
The Rot crisis forces the city to choose between brutal exclusion and experimental compassion. Jhace and Tiffani create the mirror-phase cubicles to contain the infected without exile. For a moment, they are hailed as saviors — but the solution proves too perfect, over-canceling resonance itself. Their desperate inversion leaves the city permanently weakened, even as Calix harvests their technology for war.

**Thematic Line**  
"Compassion without cost is corruption." Every act of mercy extracts a hidden systemic toll.

**Key Breadcrumbs**  
- Error string: `phase_delta = –3.00` (dismissed early, crucial later).  
- Watermarked schematics tie Tiffani’s work to Calix.  
- Tap-code bridge extended to a refugee child (personal anchor).  
- Final attunement drop: **–3 cents** permanent loss.  
- Final image: Calix’s glider carrying mirrored watermark toward Iron Republics.

**Tone & POV**  
- Primary POV: Jhace (limited third) — empathic anchor.  
- Tiffani kept opaque; her warmth shown through Jhace’s perception with occasional flickers of cold geometry.  
- Interludes: Neutral POVs showing Auditor, Calix, and Salee.
