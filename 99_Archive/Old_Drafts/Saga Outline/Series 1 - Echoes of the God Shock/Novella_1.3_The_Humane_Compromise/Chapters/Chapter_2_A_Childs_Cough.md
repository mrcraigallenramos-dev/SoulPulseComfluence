### Chapter 2: "A Child's Cough"
* Purpose: Escalate to personal stakes, seed Tiffani's manipulation.
* Core Beats:
    - A local child falls sick; lockdown begins.
    - Grahm demands hard isolation.
    - Tiffani subtly 'guides' Jhace by showing fragments of old tech, letting him *believe* the compromise idea is his.
    - **Polish**: her hand hesitates once, or her eyes flicker cold, before she resumes warmth.
* End Beat: They agree to build a prototype.
