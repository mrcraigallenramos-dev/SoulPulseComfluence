### Chapter 8: "The Fading Hum"
* Purpose: All Is Lost moment.
* Core Beats:
    - Cubicles over-cancel resonance; city hum begins to die.
    - **Polish**: physical cues â€” music out of tune, glass losing clarity, weld seams groaning.
* POV: Jhace (senses wrongness first).
* End Beat: Message: Caldera's daughter gravely ill inside cubicle.
