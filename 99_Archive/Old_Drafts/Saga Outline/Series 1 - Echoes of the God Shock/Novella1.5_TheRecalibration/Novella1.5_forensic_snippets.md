# Forensic Breadcrumbs — Novella 1.5

* Jhace placed on recalibration table; harness attaches.
* Tech’s line:
  ```
  I can't stabilize the recalibration! His resonance is being completely overwritten!
  ```
* High-frequency pulse recorded on city-wide sensor net before system crash — the “key” that awakens the gods.
* Jhace’s biometrics logged unconsciously during explosion aftermath.
* Auditor’s final ledger note:
  ```
  Detonation successful. The argument has resumed. The primary instrument remains unaware of its new design.
  ```
