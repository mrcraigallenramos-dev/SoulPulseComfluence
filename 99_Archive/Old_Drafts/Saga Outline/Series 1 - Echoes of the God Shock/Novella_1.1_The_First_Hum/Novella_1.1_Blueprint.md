# Novella 1.1 — The First Hum (Blueprint)

**Series**: Series 1 — Echoes of the God Shock  
**Word target**: 8k–18k  

## Core Ironic Seed
The teamwork and apparent compassion that first binds Tiffani and Jhace is actually Tiffani’s first field test of a deliberately manipulated resonance — the earliest step in turning Jhace into the instrument of her long con.

## Synopsis
A city-core turbine collapses into a resonance cascade — the “Divine Sickness.” Jhace, a gifted but unstable mechanic, and Tiffani, a seemingly compassionate resonance expert, are the only people able to cooperate close enough to stabilize the machine. Their attempts are messy, intimate, and costly; the joint resonance stabilizes the turbine but leaves them physically and spiritually marked. In the chaos a lowly homeless man receives a datapass by accident — the first seed that will grow into Mobel. Forensic breadcrumbs hint that Jhace’s pulse and Tiffani’s were already composite during the rescue; Jhace senses a cold geometric lattice under Tiffani’s warmth but files it away.

## Interlude
The Auditor (Tiffani’s hidden persona) watches the crisis from a place that is not a room and notes a homeless man being handed credentials by a dying official. The man — later Mobel — pockets them and the Auditor smiles like someone collecting seeds.

## Forensic Breadcrumbs
- Diagnostic log from the turbine contains a faint composite resonance trace timestamped during the sync (Jhace + Tiffani).  
- Jhace experiences a fleeting vision of a cold geometric lattice inside Tiffani’s warmth.  
- Security footage shows the official pressing a datapass into a homeless man’s hands (Mobel).  

## Key Characters
- **Jhace** — 17–25 yo mechanic. Grease-streaked, precise. Resonant hints: faint golden leaks from palms; ears bleed under strain.  
- **Tiffani** — mid-20s–30s; calm, immaculate; projects warmth. Brief cold geometric flicker appears at the edge of her healing light.  
- **Mobel (interlude)** — dirty, overlooked; accepts passcodes under pressure.  

## Setting & Tone
- **Location**: Soot-lined industrial quarter; turbine cathedral beneath the city (claustrophobic, metallic, humming).  
- **Tone**: Gritty, visceral, urgent; grimdark with small acts of compassion carrying catastrophic hidden costs.  

## Writing Guidance
- **POV**: Limited third-person focused mainly through Jhace (opening). Tiffani mostly observed — keep her interior opaque.  
- **Magic**: Grounded in physical sensations; describe resonance as visceral (taste, pressure, ringing) rather than abstract.  
- **Emotional hooks**: Emergence of intimacy through shared danger; moral ambiguity; foreshadowing of the long con.  

## Chapter Beats (Compact)
1. **Hook — Meltdown (Opening)**: alarms, hum, turbine failing. POV: Neutral/Field tech; quick to Jhace.  
2. **Aftershock — Introduce Jhace**: sense-of-wrongness, habits (tap-code, tinkering). Small empathy-vision.  
3. **Arrival — Tiffani appears**: calm competence; shows promising but opaque knowledge.  
4. **Failed Patches**: attempts fail; bureaucrats argue; stakes rise.  
5. **Close Work**: trust forms: physical, psychic sync attempt; intimate detail; small victory, cost.  
6. **Synchronized Resonance (Climax)**: joint resonance stabilizes turbine; bodily tolls (ears bleed, memory shadows).  
7. **Aftermath & Interlude seed**: praise; security clip of the pass being handed to Mobel; Auditor watching.  
8. **Tag**: Jhace notices cold lattice in Tiffani’s touch; diagnostic hint of meddling.
